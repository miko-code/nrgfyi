      <title>Power System Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/grid-managment/power-systems-felxibility/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Transition and need for flexibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no denying the fact that electricity is crucial for the world economy to thrive in this and the coming centuries. The demand for electricity increases not only because the human population increases, but also because the social-economic activities of humans are rapidly shifting from manual processes to automated processes, which are essentially driven by electricity. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;electricity becomes inevitable for the sustainability of modern civilization&lt;/strong&gt; because it has found its way to the root of many human establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power systems networks are traditionally structured and engineered to effectively accommodate the effects of uncertainty and variability of energy demand and availability of resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To transform the present carbon-intensive electricity generation system to one driven largely by clean energy sources, the inclusion of variable renewable energy sources (vRES) is becoming predominant. However, &lt;strong&gt;the inclusion of large vRES in the power plant mix increases the uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;, variability and consequently flexibility requirements on the power system network. The inclusion of cost effective and environment friendly flexible generators that can cancel the effects of uncertainty and variability is essential on power system networks with high levels of vRES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid inclusion of a large share of renewable energy into the grid is a major factor known to drive investigation into power system flexibility. vRES for electricity generation are cost effective and cheaper to acquire because of government subsidies and the absence of fuel costs. For these reasons and many more, inefficient thermal power plants that cannot compete with the vRES are being replaced by them. However, &lt;strong&gt;the outputs of vRES are not constant and therefore cause uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;. The fluctuation affects the power plant mix, power plant dispatch sequence as well as the frequency. As such, power system flexibility is inevitable. Fuel insecurity (Uncertainty of availability and fluctuation in the price) can also modify the generation mix. Other factors that drive research into flexibility of power systems include consumers’ attitude to the use of new technologies, and changes in both international and local policies and regulations as regards to conservation of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sustain modern civilization, adequate access to reliable electricity is very important. This is because electricity has its roots established in almost every human sector. It is therefore a burden on utility companies worldwide to make sure that electricity demand is always met. This is because &lt;strong&gt;every mismatch between the demand and supply of electricity can jeopardize the operational reliability of the power system network&lt;/strong&gt;. An unreliable supply of electricity has a ripple effect on the socio-economic activities of any society. Although reliable access to adequate electricity can have a positive effect on society, the method of generation is also very important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drivers of power system flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexibility describes the degree to which a power system can adjust the electricity demand or generation in reaction to both anticipated and unanticipated variability. Flexibility indicates the capacity of a power system network to reliably sustain supply during transient and large imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Association states that, “Power system flexibility is &lt;strong&gt;the ability of a power system to reliably and cost-effectively manage the variability and uncertainty of demand and supply across all relevant timescales&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources of Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, the issue of flexibility is not a major problem because vRES are very limited on the grid. As such, in the past, power system networks achieved flexibility using dispatchable power plants (e.g. gas turbines) which can be rapidly brought on and offline. In the wake of high penetration of vRES, flexibility is also attained through other means. Some of the other techniques of ensuring power system flexibilities include flexible demand (demand side management and demand response), reinforcement of distribution and transmission facilities, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, unit commitment, and generator output curtailment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand side management and demand response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In demand side management (DSM) and demand response (DR) practices, &lt;strong&gt;consumer loads are strategically controlled (technically or through incentives) by utilities to respond to imbalances in power level on the grid&lt;/strong&gt;. Connected loads can either be switched off, or its time of use shifted to off-peak periods when energy prices are lower. DR and DSM delay the addition of new facilities to avoid the need for the modification of generation levels. Implementation of DSM and DR practices will encourage and ensure that consumers take part in load control schemes which are based on price signals. DSM and DR are usually moderately inexpensive to achieve but entails following a set of strict rules and guidelines with respect to valid demand-side resources, response time, reliability and minimum magnitude. Some demand response activities include smart greed, time-of-use tariffs, direct load control by utility, interrupted load control, curtailed load, critical peak pricing, demand bidding, real time pricing, smart metering, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy storage technologies are used in storing energy generated during the periods of surplus and cheap electricity from vRES and then used when the need arises&lt;/strong&gt;. Storage devices are usually used as peaking sources.When compared to demand response, demand side management and other sources of flexibility, the investment cost spent on deploying energy storage technologies is higher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible generation is usually provided by power plants that can quickly be brought online when a power imbalance arises&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the main features of these types of flexible source is quick ramp up and ramp down, fast start up and shut down and efficient operation at a lower minimum level throughout periods of high vRES output. It is essential that these power plants have minimal marginal cost for them to effectively compete as a source of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark and Ireland, for example, are front runners in wind energy integration, with wind power shares of 44 % (RTE, 2018) and 27 %, respectively, and maximum instantaneous penetration beyond150 % and 60 % of demand, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This did not happen overnight. The power systems of both countries have been going through a transformation process from which we can extract valuable lessons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes much more economic sense to plan for flexibility rather than exploring suboptimal investments after flexibility issues arise in a power system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial amounts of VRE can be integrated by unlocking existing flexibility rather than investing in new costly assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project development time, in particular permitting and construction times, must be accounted for in the selection of solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for flexibility is based on sophisticated tools and methods that evolve over time to account for developments in the areas of policy, economy, and technology/science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational flexibility refers to how the assets in the power system are operated. It is dependent, in addition to the constraints of each technology’s capabilities, on the regulatory and market environment that surrounds the physical system and drives system operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like grids, market and regulatory frameworks can act as an inhibitor to existing flexibility. An example of a market acting as an inhibitor is the case of large countries that, from an operational perspective, are broken down into provinces operating in isolation, with limited to no exchange of energy based on centralized merit order dispatch or a market to regulate such exchange. In some cases, intra-border electricity exchanges between such provinces are limited due to a lack of efficient coordination, and as a result a portion of the system’s supply-side and grid-related flexibility is locked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central dispatching and the creation of a market to schedule electricity exchanges based on price signals are good measures to address such flexibility issues. Maintaining different, cost-reflective wholesale electricity prices for different areas within a country (zonal pricing) or for the different nodes in the transmission network (nodal pricing) also helps to reflect possible transmission congestion issues and to take them into account when building the merit order, avoiding predictable redispatch and associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the long term the system must ensure that enough operational flexibility is built so that it can operate properly with a significant level of VRE&lt;/strong&gt;. To make this possible, regulators might need to incentivize the investment by using, for example, capacity markets in which flexibility is incentivized, or by increasing the space and time granularity of wholesale markets, providing better long-term price signals to invest in flexible resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long to medium term the system has to balance the seasonal and inter-annual energy variability, which traditionally is achieved with hydro scheduling under uncertainty in systems with significant shares of hydropower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the medium to short term the commitment, and the economic dispatch, of generation units should be planned before real-time generation. In this time scale the design of day-ahead and intra-day markets will be relevant to enable the full flexibility potential of the system. Measures such as increasing time and space granularity (e. g., lower settlement period or shift from zonal to nodal prices) or setting the market’s gate closure closer to real time are measures that increase market flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the short to very short term, ancillary services markets are required to procure grid services, including to compensate for sudden imbalances between supply and demand. Here regulators need to define operating reserves in a way that flexible resources are incentivized to participate. The most innovative service – being used already by some systems, such as in the United Kingdom – is the fast frequency response (FFR) that can be supplied by batteries and VRE if the proper power electronics are in place. The challenge for the system would be to define how much inertia can be replaced by FFR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility in the Planning process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As VRE shares increase, sooner or later bridging flexibility gaps might become key for integrating additional VRE capacity. At very high shares of VRE, and after traditional flexibility sources have been fully exploited, VRE surpluses will emerge. At this point electrification becomes important to further decarbonize the energy sector through VRE (e. g., EVs and power-to-heat), and hydrogen’s role may become key to bridge seasonal imbalances between supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning early for flexibility is critical to avoid the need for costly urgent solutions once flexibility issues arise. A small and inflexible system, for example, might experience flexibility shortages at very low VRE shares, while a larger and more flexible system might experience this at a much later stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the size and level of modernization of a power system are key flexibility attributes, the choice of future potential mitigation measures also can be affected by the prospects of future demand growth. For example, many large, modern systems suffer from overcapacity that was built to support past demand growth that has now stalled due to industrialization reaching maturity and an emphasis on energy efficiency. Investment in new assets in an environment like this is more costly as system assets compete for revenue within a more challenging environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mature power system, on the other hand, many of the thermal power plants are likely to have already been depreciated, while newly built ones in power systems with growing demand might still have significant way to go before reaching break-even. IRENA addressed this topic in a dedicated working paper as part of the REmap analysis. Planning for flexibility is easier within a greenfield environment, as flexibility can be embedded in market design and grid codes for new assets, rather than having to invest in costly retrofits in both thermal and renewable power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for flexibility is a complex multi-step process that needs to account for a variety of factors that together form a complex mathematical problem that can only be solved using appropriate tools. The process typically starts with assessment of current needs and extends into the future Depending on the present status, integration measures might be necessary in the future or may already be a matter of urgency, which greatly changes the list of available options and associated costs. Assessment of current flexibility is key as it creates the foundations for a least-cost, long-term pathway for a flexible power system that is ready to incorporate significant shares of VRE.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tax equity financing structures</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/financing/tax-equity-financing-structures/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/financing/tax-equity-financing-structures/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The two main tax equity structures are sale/leasebacks and partnership/flips. The ITC is a one-time credit against income tax that is based on the amount invested in a facility. The ITC is subject to recapture if, within five years after a facility is “placed in service,” the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of the project or stops using it in a manner that qualifies for the credit – like taking it out of service or permitting the PPA off taker to operate and maintain the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sale/lease back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale/leaseback is a sale to a tax investor of solar equipment and an instant lease back to the developer of the same equipment so the developer can use it (typically to sell the generated power to a third-party host). It is attractive to developers because it offers 100% upfront financing and a “step-up” in ITC basis upon the sale for fair market value, although the IRS rules require there to be a 20% residual value at the end of the lease term, making the end-of-term purchase price higher than that seen in a partnership/flip. Documentation usually involves a Purchase Agreement and Bill of Sale (for the sale part) and a Lease Agreement and Rental Schedule (for the lease part). Investors (Lessors) will take assignment of the deal collateral (mainly project documents) under a security agreement (or, for real property, a mortgage or deed of trust). Third party consents are required for each project document, even when the document is expressly assignable, as the consents provide the investor with estoppel language and additional rights and remedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sale/leasebacks have three end-of-term options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A purchase option for fair market value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A renewal option (not to go beyond 80% of the equipment’s useful life)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A return option. The return option must be a viable option and the sale/leaseback documentation cannot be read to compel the Lessee to exercise the purchase option. It is therefore imperative that the PPA and Site Document counterpart(ies) agree that the investor (or Lessor) may take direct assignment of such project documents at the end of the sale/leaseback term in order to preserve the option for the developer (or Lessee) to return the solar equipment in place – this agreement is typically contained in the third party consents, but is even better placed in the project documents from day one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale/leaseback closing typically takes place after Substantial Completion of the project (due to a 90- day window permitted by the IRS to enter into a sale/leaseback transaction after the placed in service date and still be eligible to take the ITC) and the EPC Contract will accordingly be mostly performed – consequently, review of an EPC Contract for these transactions focuses only on warranties, indemnities, performance guarantees, and any other provision that would survive full performance or give rise to a claim (such as a guaranteed substantial completion date and subsequent LDs). As the investor is the project owner and the developer is the project company owner, it is important to note who is the beneficiary of the warranties and whether they are assignable. Further, since there is a sale of equipment taking place, it is important for the client to note whether a sales tax exemption is available in the relevant state under a “sale for resale” or other exemption for the initial sale, and what taxes are imposed on the ongoing rent payments. In sale/leaseback transactions, the developer usually takes risks relating to timing of placement in service, ITC amount, and ITC timing, and the investor usually takes risks relating to structure/true lease risk, rent accrual patterns, and residual risk (change in law risk is negotiable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSyWy-hVBKqXTr-tfNYptxiF-vDHrtnoY3jeCZsTrGJjx4-4U1gYi449Q6GFkefZRsJIYvhRzO6x3wY/pub?w=596&amp;amp;h=255&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Partnership/flip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership/flip is a simple concept - a developer brings in a tax investor as a partner to own a solar/storge project together. In a yield- based flip, the partnership allocates taxable income and loss ~99% to the investor until the investor reaches a target yield, after which its share of income and loss distributions flips to a lower percentage and the developer has an option to buy the investor’s interest. Cash is distributed in specified ratios before the flip based on expected energy production and timing of the flip date. In addition to the yield-based flip, there is also a fixed-flip structure that is used principally by US Bank and leaves as much cash as possible to the developer – in these, there is usually a cash flip at the 5th year and a tax flip at the 6-7th year, with a 2% preference to the investor and some sharing on additional distributions if production is good. Flip deals are different than sale/leasebacks in terms of the amount of capital raised, risk allocation and the timing of when the investor must invest. A sale/leaseback provides the developer with the full fair market value of the project (in theory). In a partnership/flip, the investor contribution is usually 40% to 85% of the fair market value and the developer must provide the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the investor to be eligible for the ITC, it must be a partner in the partnership prior to the assets being placed in service – for this reason, investors typically contribute 20% of their investment related to a project after mechanical completion of such project, but before it is placed in service. The remaining 80% is typically contributed after substantial completion of the project is achieved. For this reason, financing parties review an EPC Contract for a partnership/flip transaction with more emphasis on the requirements for mechanical completion, as well as the remaining obligations of the EPC contractor after mechanical completion is achieved. Unlike in a sale/leaseback, the investor is taking some construction risk – for the period between mechanical and substantial completion – and will care about contractor obligations and remedies from and after the mechanical completion date. Also, unlike a sale/leaseback transaction, the investor is an owner in the project company and will not be taking a security interest in the project documents – therefore only an estoppel certificate will be required from the third parties (and no third-party consents to assignment).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaling Up Private Finance for Clean Energy in Emerging and Developing Economies</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/financing/private-finance-for-clean-energy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/financing/private-finance-for-clean-energy/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This intend to be a summary  post of the “Scaling up Private Finance for Clean Energy in  Emerging and Developing Economies” &lt;a href=&#34;https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/a48fd497-d479-4d21-8d76-10619ce0a982/ScalingupPrivateFinanceforCleanEnergyinEmergingandDevelopingEconomies.pdf&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by the IEA and IFC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emerging Markets and Developing Economics (EMDEs) group contains the following territories: Africa, Developing Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In EMDEs there are 775 million people that lack access to electricity and 2.4B that lack access to clean cooking fuels. Clean technologies offer a compelling way forward and their use is growing, but, in most cases, energy demand is growing even faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, 770B USD invested each year in clean energy in EMDEs, but most of this is in a handful of large economies. China accounts for 2/3 of this total and together with India and Brazil accounts for more than ¾ of it. Growth in clean energy investment is a precondition not only for tackling climate change, but also to help reach a range of other sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as poverty reduction, health, and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0weOyWCI_vN9CXLd4Icu0P-PfTCtpjuBhz_Lhbq7w-xTcusSA7Xx1ktkALjyRRBgtHdH8LbTRF0WqmqTvkuxirBT8H9AA-UtpzBMNL-l1iVqs8kF4JBtYg1kwo_blwhC34VdxSIogCPGF6GlBG_yZg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring up the level of private investors and financing solutions providers, policy makers, governments and other stakeholders will need to deal with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a healthy and balanced investments environment in terms of the right ratio for each type of investor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create clear environment of regulation and policy to reduce country and sector risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support new financing instruments to provide confidence for investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To meet rising energy needs in ways that align with the Paris agreement, annual investments (public and private) will need to be more than triple, compared to today’s level, reaching 2.8 trillion USD per year by 2030&lt;/strong&gt;. This surge in investment provides a powerful opportunity to underpin sustainable economic growth, create jobs and provide full energy access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen in the chart below, just over 1/3 of total EMDE clean energy investment goes into low-emissions generation, mainly to renewables. Another 1/3 needed for improvements in efficiency and spending in end use sectors, under ¼ is needed for electricity grids and storage, around 8% goes to low-emission fuels, such as biofuels, low-emission hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZPiZAU8Euj4cwtxh-12yARNuOblcbuNGfH8eq4hSrV4iRrnmppdZWFs68KChDRnWR7KyzyCg3UItnzU1Y_9G6_SHNUGNm03DRqTao5xhzluy-a_dtRmfQ6VprZh3oy2hL7sKbeDi2Wow4G84tsjsiA&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 finance by public entities accounted for about half of EMDE clean energy spending compared to less than 20% in advanced economies.  Bringing in private capital at the scale and pace needed will require developing a much larger flow of clean energy projects that match investors’ risk and return expectations. Now, the cost of capital for the same type of project can be two or three times higher compared to advanced economies, due to the inherent risks attached to these territories. Tackling those risks will be an essential part of bringing down the cost of capital for better cooperation between the private and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different potential sources include governments and development finance institutions (DFIs), including multilateral and national development banks; philanthropies; commercial banks; institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds; private equity funds; firms that reinvest their profits; and households and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respective roles and responsibilities of the different public and private actors vary by country, but there are common themes. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) tend to be major players for EMDE investment in electricity networks, and in nuclear and large hydropower projects. The direct role of governments as investors typically focuses on major infrastructure projects – sometimes in partnership with the private sector. Direct public support is also vital for the development of more nascent technologies, via funding for research and development and for first-of-a-kind projects. Public procurement policies offer an opportunity for governments to establish and grow markets for efficient and low-carbon equipment and materials. This can help drive down costs and provide consumer confidence in the adoption of such technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many EMDEs, regional governments and municipalities play important roles in electricity and energy provision as well as public transport. Building up clean energy infrastructure can be an important element of broader strategies to attract non-energy investment, especially as firms integrate sustainability criteria into investment decisions and look for locations with access to renewable and other low-carbon sources of electricity and fuels. This is a growing issue for many EMDE firms as they see on the horizon that access to certain major international markets may be shaped by their environmental performance, as with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation and Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New policies in Europe, the United States and other advanced economies are attracting significant new investments in clean energy, spurring technology learning and innovation but making it more challenging for EMDEs to compete for private capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace of innovation in clean energy technologies is promising, with much of the sector seeing significant increases in capacity and declines in cost. However, much of this push has taken place in advanced economies and China, and more recently other large emerging economies. This leaves many other developing economies still struggling with accessibility and high costs of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing climate change requires broadly two types of actions: mitigation of GHG emissions; and adaptation to minimize damage resulting from climate change and extreme weather events. Every country needs to address both issues with priority action according to their circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public interventions are needed to create the incentives for additional private finance in EMDEs to differing degrees across all aspects of energy transitions. These aspects can be grouped into three: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The supply side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power and fuels transitions&lt;/strong&gt; - The power transition involves accelerating the ongoing shift to low-emission electricity produced by renewables and nuclear power. Specifically, renewables mean investment in solar PV, wind (onshore and offshore), hydro, geothermal, bioenergy and other renewable technologies. The power transition also includes investment in strengthening and restructuring the underlying electricity grid networks (transmission and distribution). Given the intermittency of some renewable sources such as solar and wind, investment in a range of sources of flexibility in power market operation is essential, including robust grids, dispatchable generation, storage (including batteries) and demand response. The fuels transition relates to the phasing down of fossil fuels, namely coal, oil, natural gas and their derivatives, and the scaling up of low-emission fuels, such as low-emission hydrogen (including hydrogen produced via electrolysis, using renewables), modern liquid and gaseous biofuels, and synthetic fuels. It also includes investment in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The demand side, the end-use transition&lt;/strong&gt; - The end-use transition includes shifts in the energy used by all enterprises and households, with a focus on decarbonization investments for three major end users of fuels: industrial production; transport; and buildings. It includes investments in energy efficiency and savings, with the introduction of economic incentives for a full circular economy that minimizes waste in energy and materials use. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for private finance in EMDEs is a derived demand. It is derived from the volume of projects that meet attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to other global bankable projects. Currently the main constraint to financing is not the supply of private finance, but the absence of projects at a scale that is necessary for the transitions to be realized. The main reason for the absence of enough projects, in turn, is the absence of a robust policy and regulatory framework, including the needed flow of concessional resources, to close the gap between private and social returns and thereby improve relative risk-adjusted returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective policy and regulatory framework is required to address those variations in country-specific costs and risks that are particularly acute in EMDEs. These are risks that raise the cost of capital in EMDEs relative to advanced countries (particularly relevant for high CAPEX/low-OPEX projects that characterize many renewable projects), a cost that cannot be compensated for by higher, though still uncertain returns, and cannot be controlled by the project investor, they include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macroeconomic risks and political instability of the host country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underdeveloped markets, such as financial markets, which reduce the ability to manage financial risks such as foreign exchange risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policy risk, regulatory shortfalls, and corruption, including renewable generation offtake risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher costs of doing business due to poor infrastructure, reduced human capital, the overall business environment and investors’ lack of experience in many EMDE markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to measures and mitigate country-sector-project specific risks and costs, additional regulations, and policies, including concessional resources, may in many instances be needed to enhance private returns on clean energy projects relative to fossil fuel production and use, and relative to clean energy projects in advanced countries. In choosing which projects to support, policy makers should use the social rate of return on investment as the appropriate benchmark. It accounts for externalities including all environmental and social co-benefits associated with the abatement of GHGs, other market failures, and other transaction costs that lead to divergences between private and social net benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy measures taken by governments are a key determinant of how much capital is committed to the energy sector, and where and how it is invested. The energy crisis has prompted new initiatives aimed at advancing clean energy deployment and addressing existing and emerging energy security risks. Some of the most prominent have been in advanced economies, with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, the Fit for 55 package and the Green Industrial Plan in the European Union, and the GX Green Transformation program in Japan. China has also stepped-up policy support for a range of clean energy technologies and there are examples too in other EMDEs, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India’s&lt;/strong&gt; launch of a &lt;strong&gt;Green Energy Corridor program&lt;/strong&gt; to evacuate power from renewable-rich states to India’s power demand centers. Phase II of the scheme, with a project cost of USD 1.5 billion, was initiated in January 2022. In January 2023 India also initiated the National Green Hydrogen Mission, with earmarked government funding of USD 2.4 billion and a target to mobilize almost USD 100 billion in investment to develop green hydrogen production capacity of 5 million tons per annum by 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The conclusion of Just Energy Transition Partnerships&lt;/strong&gt; (JETPs) with &lt;strong&gt;Indonesia&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;South&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Africa&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Viet Nam&lt;/strong&gt;, offering a new model for international support for national efforts to scale up renewables, reduce reliance on coal and other polluting fuels, and manage the social implications of change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A revamped &lt;strong&gt;procurement framework&lt;/strong&gt; for renewable power in &lt;strong&gt;Cambodia&lt;/strong&gt;, using competitive auctions and blended finance packages to boost market development, reduce revenue risks and lower financing costs. As part of the auction, the Cambodian single-buyer utility provides 20-year power purchase contracts, complemented by a loan from the Asian Development Bank (blended finance) to fund grid infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;tender program&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Chile’s&lt;/strong&gt; Economic Development Agency in 2021, worth up to USD 50 million, to develop green hydrogen projects that are to install 10 MW (or more) of capacity and commence commercial operation by the end of 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/strong&gt; becoming in 2021 the first of the major Gulf oil and gas producers to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, including a 30% share for renewables plus nuclear by 2030.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two new transmission auctions&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt; that would amount to approximately USD 10 billion in new investment, a similar amount to that of the entire 2018-2022 period. The first transmission auction, announced in March 2023, was for the construction and maintenance of nearly 5 000 km of transmission lines to support further wind and solar deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenya&lt;/strong&gt; introducing &lt;strong&gt;net metering regulations&lt;/strong&gt; for distributed PV capacity, after passing enabling legislation in 2019. The regulations allow electricity consumers with on-site generation (no more than 1 MW) to sell excess power to the national grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financing Instruments&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Blended finance” is a combination of concessional funds from donors and commercial funds from private investors and development finance institutions. It is used to enable investment in projects that have high development impact but are not yet commercially viable, such as those with high upfront costs or involving adoption of new technologies that have not yet scaled up. Concessional funds are deployed to provide partial guarantees or subordinated debt or equity, cover some project development costs, or create performance-based incentives for project sponsors to meet targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowd-in effect of blended finance is best illustrated by its “leverage”, defined as the ratio of commercial financing (from DFIs, sponsors and private financiers) to the amount of concessional funds. Based on IFC’s experience, USD 1 of concessional donor funding has leveraged on average nearly USD 7 of additional finance, comprising USD 3-4 of IFC own funds and USD 3-4 of commercial third-party capital from private sponsors and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For climate transactions, the ratio tends to be higher (USD 1 to USD 10), comprising USD 3 of IFC’s own funds and USD 7 of commercial third-party capital. This is due to relatively large project finance structures (using senior and mezzanine debt products) and significant deployment in middle-income countries that can crowd-in more commercial finance due to their generally lower country risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blende finance instruments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border=&#39;1&#39;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instrument&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Details&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concessional Loan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concessional senior loan, priced below market; or subordinated loan in liquidation and/or in payments to all senior lenders, also priced concessionally.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Guarantee&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt; First loss cover, up to an agreed maximum amount. Can be protected as a (funded or unfunded) guarantee on a single loan, or as a pooled first loss guarantee on a portfolio of loans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particularly in the context of power generation projects, liquidity support guarantee can be provided on a revolving standby letter of credit (LC), that can be drawn by the project company if the off taker fails to honor its payment obligation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concessional equity&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Lower-priced” equity with a lower internal rate of return to offer affordable equity funding; or subordinated equity with cash waterfall (distribution of all proceeds including exit and dividends according to a waterfall).&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Investment grant&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance-based incentive (PBI): rebates to provide incentives and disincentives to achieve desired outcomes or results (e.g. tie at least a portion of payments to achievement and aim to reward innovation and successful implementation).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viability gap funding (VGF): capital grant provided up to certain percentage of total investment costs for projects that are not commercially viable yet due to long gestation period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bond investment&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instrument like a loan, can be traded privately or publicly, offshore, or onshore. Can be used with PBIs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Local Currency support&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Concessional funds to provide fully or partially subsidized currency hedge; or concessional loan with a subsidized spread (or with a swap-cost buydown) to absorb the high cost of currency hedge.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to (or in combination with) blended finance, new financial instruments and platforms are needed to mobilize private capital at a scale. Green, social, sustainable and sustainability linked (GSSS) bonds have the potential to attract more private climate financing into EMDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSSS bonds and loans definition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Instrument&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Definition&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Green bond/loan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fixed-income instruments with proceeds earmarked exclusively for projects with environmental benefits&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Social bond/loan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fixed-income instruments with proceeds directed towards projects that aim to achieve positive social outcomes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sustainable bond/loan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Debt instruments that finance a combination of green and social projects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sustainability-linked bond/loan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Performance-based debt instruments whereby financial or structural objectives, such as the coupon rate, are adjusted depending on predefined sustainability objectives&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project aggregation platforms and securitization vehicles can overcome the asymmetry between the relatively small size of most energy transition projects in EMDEs and the relatively large minimum investment size that major institutional investors require. These platforms can pool large numbers of smaller projects and thereby create standardized investment-grade multi-asset portfolios, reducing transaction costs, diversifying risk, and attracting interest from institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluntary carbon markets have the potential to channel more resources into clean energy investment in EMDEs but need strong oversight to grow from today’s low base. Carbon credits linked to real, verifiable emission reductions could be a valuable revenue stream for EMDEs, but there is still much work to be done on standards and monitoring, reporting, and verification processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Main EU Markets for co-located projects</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/main-eu-markets-for-co-located-projects/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/main-eu-markets-for-co-located-projects/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drivers for implements hybrid projects in the UK are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced grid services&lt;/strong&gt;: The UK comprises the most advanced standalone battery storage market in Europe, having pioneered since 2017 through the proliferation of grid-services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mature Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to vast commercialization expertise, the industry is the most welcoming when it comes to innovation such as co-located assets and Hybrid PPAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UK is Europe’s largest energy storage market&lt;/strong&gt; – by far. Advanced sophistication of network operators, regulators and legislators has created a plethora of innovative regulated grid services, Europe’s archetype Capacity Market (CM), and lucrative opportunities through balancing services incentivizing the deployment of fast-responding batteries over the past few years. As of Q2 22023, installed capacity of battery storage is more than 1.9GW – 1.5GW of which on a standalone basis and 270MW co-located with renewable energy projects. Some 2.3GW is under construction, and 11.5GW have received planning approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a financing perspective, both equity and debt are familiar with the asset’s risk profile, with the presence of listed storage-dedicated funds being responsible for a wide portion of large storage capacity commissioning every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, the market has experienced profound growth acting as a blueprint for further European deployment. Looking at the applications for permits submitted by year (irrespective of the outcome of the application), in Q1 2023 the volume of hybrid solar projects seeking approval (3,4GW) significantly outgrew applications of standalone solar (921MW). Such data are great to understand the intentions of local developers and confirm the trend we saw in the beginning of the report towards the momentum in co-locating storage with renewable generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a surprise that the UK is also hosting Europe’s first contractual arrangements for co-located assets. Starting from the first-ever floor storage optimization agreement between solar developer Anesco signed a floor storage optimization agreement with EDF Energy, in partnership with Upside Energy (now Kraken Energy) for the optimization of 10MW Clayhill farm, which was co-located with a 6MW (2 x 1.5MW) battery storage asset. It was the first time a storage optimization agreement was offered on a floor basis, to increase certainty of revenue, with the deal offering optimization of both the solar and storage asset. The project was already commissioned for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drivers for implements hybrid projects in Spain are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased solar cannibalization risk: As of 2022, Spain hosted more than 19GW of installed solar capacity, with the price cannibalization effect already impacting the country’s sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need for more Sophisticated volume structure: Spain is set to remain a top market for merchant renewables across Europe, with corporate PPAs being a main tool to finance new additions. Sophisticated offtake demand requires innovation from the sell PPA side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain doesn’t currently have advanced grid services offering route to market for energy storage assets, neither an up-and-running Capacity Market. Therefore, the driver for hybrid projects is different to the UK, and the focus is on improving asset performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the Spanish Government has indicated its intentions to support further integration of smart renewables, with a key signal having come from direct grants supporting the up to 65% of the capex for storage additions either to existing or new renewables projects. In addition, the country has made significant steps towards improving the legislative and regulatory environment for the new asset class, giving the country a positive outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drivers for implements hybrid projects in Germany are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovation auction: The country was the first to hold government-backed auctions for hybrid projects, with solar-plus-storage having swept more than 1GW of the awarded capacity. Due to the merchant element included in the partial subsidy scheme, such hybrid assets could be on the look-out for further contractual arrangements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-driven dynamics such as increased volatility in wholesale markets and price cannibalization: As the country is home to some of the largest renewables capacity per capita, price cannibalization and the risk of negative pricing are increasingly concerning the renewable energy industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years back, when the term ‘energy storage’ started making its appearance in the vocabulary of European renewables, Germany was a front-runner in driving deployment of the ‘exotic’ asset class. As Germany also constitutes the prime early adopter of renewables, with some of the largest installed capacity of solar pv and onshore wind across Europe, it didn’t come as a surprise that Germany was also ready to dominate in the energy transition 2.0 phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an ancillary services perspective and available routes-to-market, some years back Germany’s Primary Control Reserve (FCR) market, which is a form of frequency regulation, attracted a fair amount of investment in standalone battery storage facilities, making it the second-largest battery storage market in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the country did not maintain momentum in enriching grid-focused routes to market for storage assets the way the UK did. Fast forward to the present, amid pressure from the EU for all member states to set robust targets and use-cases for energy storage, Germany is already focusing on improving the grid-services set up to be more inclusive to storage assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that not all existing and future installations are market dynamics driven. For example, local utilities energy storage projects to better manage their responsibilities and operations – which is also a prime reason behind the vast contractual activity between local utilities and either standalone or co-located energy storage projects across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the so-called ‘Grid Booster’ projects have started making their appearance over the past years, fulfilling the popular prophecy that energy storage could replace expensive grid infrastructure updates. More specifically, the country’s transmission system operators, who have the responsibility of balancing the hefty renewable energy generated in the north with the consumption side in the south, are increasingly planning energy-storage-as-transmission projects across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany also has a prolific residential storage market – the largest in Europe – as more and more households are looking to retrofit their rooftop solar pv systems when they exit their subsidy period. By July 2023, aggregated capacity reached an impressive 4.2GW across more than 801k installations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nordics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drivers for implements hybrid projects in the Nordics are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price cannibalization mainly affecting onshore wind: Wide deployment of onshore wind in the Nordic countries has resulted in notably low capture factors thus far, and therefore significant profile costs. As the cannibalization risk increases in the future, the industry is exploring the concept of energy storage to capture better rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baseload PPAs requiring a physical hedge: Baseload PPAs have been traditionally popular in the wider Nordics region. Amid increasing market risks around profile, price and committed volumes, the region is a prime candidate for innovation in the wind-plus-storage space to mitigate risk exposure of baseload hedges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have deployed generous onshore wind capacity and certain regions are responsible for some of Europe’s first merchant onshore wind assets brought to life under private PPA arrangements. But with more capacity connected to the grid, price cannibalization particularly for onshore wind has made its appearance well ahead of other European onshore wind markets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contractual arrangement in Hybrid PPA’s agreements.</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/ppa/contractual-arrangement-in-hybrid-ppas-agreements/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/ppa/contractual-arrangement-in-hybrid-ppas-agreements/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which a Hybrid PPA can work. Just like the technical set up of each co-located project, there is no one size fits all when it comes to the commercialization aspect. It always comes down to investment goals, risk appetite and the capabilities when it comes to trading assets of each asset owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewable PPA &amp;amp; Storage Capacity agreement (CSA)/Optimization agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the hybrid arrangement comprises two contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The typical renewable PPA for the generation asset, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A separate contract for the storage assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two assets operate independently and have separate contractual agreements, merely sharing the technical and financial benefits of sitting on the same site. However, some synergies between the contracts do remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage contract is either an Optimization Agreement – which is a route-to-market service arrangement with storage optimization companies where asset owners outsource the bidding strategy of the asset to tap grid services – or a Storage Capacity Agreement. The latter comprises an availability contract where the buyer sets the periods at which the storage asset needs to be readily available to meet the buyer’s needs. In essence, it’s practically renting out the storage asset to a third party, which renders the agreement more transactional (contrary to a service one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, optimizers share the revenue they achieve with the asset owner. Such service providers either offer a set floor price, which means that the price risk is shared between the optimizer and the asset owner or pay the asset owner a share of the profits monthly. The possibility of a mix of such payment methods is also possible. In negotiation processes, the storage owner will receive various bids from optimizers, and they’ll have to choose their preferred one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity agreements appear more in markets with limited wholesale and ancillary services capabilities. In the US, buyers of capacity contracts are usually utilities that are responsible for the grid’s health, and they typically ‘rent-out’ storage assets from their owner. In exchange, they offer fixed capacity payments – also known as ‘Tolling Payments’, based on the project capacity. In essence, such agreements do not differ dramatically from the contracts deriving from Capacity Markets across Europe, where the grid operator – or the responsible agent – rents out storage asset in case of need (capacity notification), and they offer fixed payments per MW (even if the assets end up never being needed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment arrangements and the choice of contracts for the storage asset is extremely linked to the risk appetite of both the buyer and the seller. A useful analogy could be comparing investing in bolds vs the stock market. Sellers who prefer fixed payments with potentially limited upside feel more comfortable with fixed capacity payments, or floor-like optimization contracts. Revenue sharing arrangements mirror investing more in the stock market, where some months revenues could be limited – but some months higher than expected. Payments usually take place on a fixed price per MWh basis for the PPA, and in EUR/MW monthly for the storage asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential off takers for the entire Hybrid PPA with an optimization agreement include utilities with trading capabilities, where they’d like to share the profit from the revenues achieved in the grid services markets. Utilities with grid responsibilities are prime candidates for tolling payments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros: The core benefit is that the value coming from each asset is more easily identifiable. Often, this has made financing of co-located assets more straight forward because each asset is financed on the back of their own contractual arrangements. In early-stage markets, such structures are more easily digestible from market players and financiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons: It can be challenging to make sure that the two contracts are not impinging one another. For example, what happens when the generation asset is blocking the interconnection and the battery cannot export when needed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaped Renewable PPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the two assets share contractual agreements resulting in a Hybrid Shaped Pay As-Produced (PAP) PPA. Such a deal aims to mimic the demand of a particular off taker who’s interested, for example, in structures like Fixed-Hourly Profile (FHP) delivery (typically seen thus far in solar PPAs) or Baseload PPAs (usually seen in wind PPAs). However, the revolution of a Shaped Renewable PPA is that such arrangements could become technology agnostic. This PPA structure incentivizes the delivery of a shaped profile using storage, therefore profile and volume risk are fully assumed by the seller (and mitigated using storage) and is priced accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pricing could be variable, with different pricing levels for each MWh, depending on when it’s delivered. In some cases, there could be a 12x24 energy rate whereby the contract has different pricing levels, meaning that every hour of every month could have a different price depending on what time the energy is delivered to the metering point, and consequently to the consumer. The pricing takes place on a variable (but agreed) EUR/MWh instead of fixed pricing for all the volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset owners must be willing to accommodate such a shaped profile and feel comfortable that they can deliver the agreed MWh either through the storage, or through buying back the open position from the market (just like in Baseload PPAs). One of the reasons there may be a need to buy back from the market is because in this scenario the storage asset can also participate in grid services. Therefore, sometimes participation in an ancillary service, for example, could conflict with the delivery of the agreed MWh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential buyers could include corporates interested in 24/7 delivery, where there’s an hourly matching of green energy throughout the day. There’s currently some exploration in the market of how portfolios comprised of a mix of solar, wind and storage could deliver baseload (as in, continuous) power to interested corporate parties. In addition, certain utilities with strict mandates could also benefit from such a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros: The vast advantage of such a structure is that the seller can put a premium next to baseload delivery, while mitigating profile and volume risk. In addition, due to the existence of storage, there’s optionality of how energy can be delivered to the buyer; either in a physical manner through the energy storage, or in financial terms through accessing the spot market. Although this is considered a risk in Baseload PPAs, in a Shaped Profile PPA it becomes an advantage because of the optionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons: Due to volatility, an element of price risk will remain when there’s an open position that needs to settle in the spot market. Depending on how long the periods of the premium rate will be, the asset owner may also need to make extra arrangements to make use of the storage asset when it’s not needed from the buyer, and the synergies between the two need to be very visible to understand the risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blended Renewable &amp;amp; Storage Premium PPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, this is another Pay-as-Produced (PAP) volume structure where contractual arrangements between the two assets are shared. The Hybrid PPA entails a premium rate for all the MWh to be delivered, which is the main difference with the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such structure inherently incorporates the benefits of profile shaping of a PAP PPA, because it takes into consideration the adapted behavior of how the renewable asset will operate together with storage, determining the value of the new profile and therefore its premium pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Components driving PPA price and their risks.</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/ppa/components-driving-ppa-price-and-their-risks./</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/ppa/components-driving-ppa-price-and-their-risks./</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;PPA structures are evolving, and the challenge of Hybrid PPAs lies behind understanding and quantifying the benefits of flexibility, and how it’s reflected in the pricing. The risk profile of the asset is the core determinant of its fair value. And since energy storage changes the risk profile of the generation part, this would need to be reflected in the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand what’s driving the Hybrid PAP pricing, it would be better to go through how benchmark PPA prices are modelled, and the risk components driving the fair value of the energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the components driving PPA Prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid PAP PPAs come with a premium. To better understand how the value of the storage is influencing the PPA price, we are illustrating exactly which risk components and costs have an impact. This is why there’s no one ‘universal truth’ PPA price, but benchmark PPA prices instead which are then applied on a case-by-case basis by involved parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The components who drive the PPA pricing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PPA Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value of baseload power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The first step in PPA pricing is understanding the value of the baseload energy, which is different from market to market. To infer what the future value of baseload prices would be, traded futures contracts are used as a reference, since there’s no visibility of the future spot prices to understand the value of baseload power in the wholesale markets.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;For producers, price risk is the uncertainty of not knowing the future value of the energy the asset will produce throughout the life-cycle of the asset. The uncertainty stems from the high volatility seen in the wholesale and futures markets. Market-based PPA pricing calibrates traded contracts in the futures markets to understand the future value of the baseload energy, In illiquid markets with opaque pricing visibility where term contracts (futures) have a liquid horizon of 1-3 years, price risk is likely to be larger.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capture Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Capture risk refers to the probability of price cannibalization in the spot markets, which could occur when renewable energy with the same profile pattern produces at the same time depressing the wholesale price (and therefore the revenues the asset will get at that point of time). In the modelling, capture risk quantifies the probability of cannibalization to occur.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Volume risk illustrates the long-term variations between expected and actual production, as a result of the inherent weather-dependent liability of renewables.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The magnitude of the imbalance cost is driven by the actual deviations between scheduled production and real production (“forecast error”), the regulatory design of the balancing market (i.e., punitive design with penalties) and whether portfolio effects may exist. The seller usually has a balancing agreement with a third party for a fee as a mitigation tool, which as the energy mix fills in with more intermittent renewables, could increase significantly&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grid Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Grid costs refer to grid usage fees that asset owners (and every network user) need to pay to network operators to connect their assets and transfer their electrons to the grid.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Profile costs occur when cannibalization has driven capture factors below 1, reducing the value of the energy produced. Capture risk is the probability of cannibalization to occur, and profile costs are the result of when cannibalization does materialize&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedging costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The last cost to take into consideration is the cost of hedging, which is applicable primarily to trading houses and utilities. The cost accrues through ‘stack’n’roll hedging’ which requires back-to back deals possibly resulting in losses when the price you buy and sell is not consistent, and administrative cost fees of transactions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, moving to Hybrid PPA pricing the key influencers is capture risk, deriving from the profile shape, and profile costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, energy storage is among the prime physical tools to mitigate capture risk, because through profile shaping the storage element can shift the power delivery to slots when the electrons are needed the most. The renewable asset can react to daily pricing patterns, resulting in an optimized delivery of the electrons, when they are needed the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, price cannibalization can go as far as negative pricing, while there may also be cases of curtailment where the grid operator will order plants to shut down. In terms of financial hedging, profile risk can only be transferred from one party to the other. However, through the addition of a physical hedge, the timely reaction to daily pricing patterns not only results in reduced profile costs, but such costs could become profile benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profile costs are measured with a view of historic and estimated forward capture factors. Such metrics illustrate the ratio between baseload prices (in this case the average spot price over a selected timeframe) and the capture prices (the average prices each generator will manage to realize over a period of time). Not all technologies share the same capture prices, with the main factor that influences achieved revenues being the seasonality of production. Since renewables are inherently intermittent, the narrative of the cannibalization effect is mainly intertwined with wind and solar, contrary to thermal production technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more renewables get connected to the grid, price cannibalization across Europe is set to increase, driving down capture factors. Improved capture factors influence PPA pricing either directly – through a Premium Hybrid PAP – or indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter applies to Baseload PPAs, where even though energy storage may not necessarily play a role in the BL hedge structure, the seller has visibility of their capture risk which is directly linked to the management of their open position, when the asset is not able to deliver the agreed volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Future energy storage and distribution</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/future-energy-storage-and-distribution/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/future-energy-storage-and-distribution/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is no longer a secret, nor a great insight, that we are in a
revolutionary era in terms of the energy industry. Many technologies ,
greener and cheaper are implemented , a lot of assets we uses are being
electrified
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/electric-vehicle-market-5179&#34;&gt;EV&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;
, heating solution) and more and energy , in general becomes more of
commodity than an production resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that development, new challenges and limitations arise and create
risks for industrial, commercial, and residential uses and processes.
Our current power grids weren&amp;rsquo;t designed for the challenges they have
today - from EV&amp;rsquo;s to renewables, climate change and urbanization, so the
grid needs to be upgraded constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support grid distribution limitations, there is a need to improve and
create more solutions in the field of distribution and energy storage.
Energy storage is essential for the transition to a decarbonized economy
based on renewable energy sources, and energy distribution needs to be
smarter and more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the fast implementation of EV&amp;rsquo;s, there will be a need to support
the EV&amp;rsquo;s needs in terms of charging and electricity. As of today, most
of the needs are local, and can be resolved through local applications
such as microgrid or even home battery charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of distribution, we should expect development in the low
voltage network controls. In leveraging the power of distributed
intelligence, which features continuous insight analytics, and control,
utility companies can redefine what is possible with low-voltage network
management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, energy distribution systems are used as a hub through a single
source, power station, that can be either coal, gas, nuclear, hydro,
solar or wind. That energy is then distributed through a high-voltage
grid before being converted to low-voltage at the consumer end using
substations. In the future, while we continue to have the large-scale
energy system, we will see an increase in power generated at the edge of
the network through micro power stations, solar, wind and all forms of
renewables. This will be complemented with battery technologies to store
when needed. To implement this change requires a new grid distribution
and operational system for the major utility companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the following
&lt;a href=&#34;https://infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-2021.pdf&#34;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;,
Over the period between 2017-2021, transmission and distribution and
reliability-focused pipeline investments have increased, and outages
have declined slightly. Annual spending on high voltage transmission
lines grew from $15.6 billion in 2012 to $21.9 billion in 2017, while
annual spending on distribution systems &amp;mdash; the &amp;ldquo;last mile&amp;rdquo; of the
electricity network &amp;mdash; grew 54% over the past two decades. Utilities
are taking proactive steps to strengthen the electric grid through
resilience measures. However, weather remains an increasing threat.
Among 638 transmission outage events reported from 2014 to 2018, severe
weather was cited as the predominant cause. Additionally, distribution
infrastructure struggles with reliability, with 92% of all outages
occurring along these segments. In the coming years, additional
transmission and distribution infrastructure, smart planning, and
improved reliability are needed to accommodate the changing energy
landscape, as delivery becomes distributed, and renewables
grow[.]{dir=&amp;ldquo;rtl&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batteries expected to be used for short-term storage while thermal and
mechanical storage will be used for industrial heat and electricity for
mid-term storage and electrolyzes will turn excess power from renewables
will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be
stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other
sectors of the economy as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the 3 trends who impacts the energy value chain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://peggysmedleyshow.com/a-primer-on-clean-energy&#34;&gt;Renewables&lt;/a&gt;
&amp;ndash; technology around renewables is becoming more efficient in terms
of solar panels, wind farms, heat pumps, safe nuclear, and more.
Availability across the whole value chain &amp;ndash; from large utilities to
business and consumers- is critical, and this can enable
self-generation and provide additional energy back to the grid when
surplus is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitalization/Modernization&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Transformation of the energy
sector through virtualization will require robust, scalable, and
reliable communications infrastructure to enable monitoring and
control leveraging the power. For instance, AI can enable energy
systems to make intelligent decisions about where, how, and when
they consume power in real-time. Edge compute platforms can extract,
store, and utilize data at scales, supported by AI accelerators and
automated processes , to schedule , manage , and automate the use of
renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The Value of Energy storage in Europe</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/the-value-of-energy-storage-in-europe/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/the-value-of-energy-storage-in-europe/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy storage has been deemed one of the missing links of the energy transition for quite some time now. After the vast deployment of standalone storage assets, which tirelessly (and swiftly) respond for duty when the grid needs it, the long-awaited next phase of renewables-plus storage is finally approaching the mainstream!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term ‘renewables-plus-storage colocation’ has climbed the ladder in the renewable’s vocabulary, particularly in the merchant renewables sphere. But combining two business models requires the resolution of multiple riddles. What is the optimal use-case of the hybrid set-up? What’s the optimal revenue streams strategy when there are competing interests between the two assets? How does the industry model a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate an investment decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of flexibility, not only for individual assets, but for the entire electricity system is widely recognized. On one hand, the ability to bid into the market and deliver grid services contributes to tangible ‘value creation’ for storage assets. Overall, policy and regulation players in each country have operated with different gears on that front, in the sense that value creation in each market differs. There’s a wide push for more and more jurisdictions to get up to speed with route-to-market visibility to encourage further deployment. &lt;a href=&#34;https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/markets-and-consumers/market-legislation/electricity-market-design_en&#34;&gt;The EU’s landmark Electricity Market Design&lt;/a&gt; proposed reform comprises the ultimate testament to the increased ambitions on a regional and member state level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, ‘value capture’ is the tough job of how to tap such value and convert it into realized revenue. This is where tools like optimization agreements, contractual arrangements, and Hybrid PPAs fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in the asset class is growing exponentially both by policy and regulation (value creation) but modelling the value of storage for an investment case (value capture) is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When it comes to monetization of energy storage assets, it’s really the billion -dollar question to underpin the entire business case. The valuation aim is no different than any other infrastructure investment: investors need to understand the asset’s risk-return profile, its expected revenues and estimated internal rate of return (IRR) to understand whether the investment is worth pursuing. But with energy storage assets, performing this task is not as straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the energy transition, the risk profile of renewables attracted financiers like pension funds, institutional investors, and lenders due to the asset mirroring the characteristics of ‘core infrastructure’ assets: low-return low-risk asset profiles which are able to generate stable yields. Since then, not only have the risks profile of renewables evolved, but new asset classes with different risk profiles were deemed necessary and required calibration of investment strategies. And yes, energy storage was the first new asset class to rock the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetizing strategies for storage are ever evolving. Starting from grid-level opportunities, grid operators and regulators are creating a plethora of routes to market in the form of grid services for energy storage (and particularly fast responding battery storage) to support the technology’s deployment and eventually take advantage of its competitive edge: quick flexibility to replace services that used to be provided by retiring thermal plants, and tackle supply/demand imbalances from increased renewables penetration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most critical revenue streams exist through imbalance markets, such as the UK’s Balancing Market (BM) daily auctions, Capacity Markets (CM) or regulation ancillary services such as Fast Frequency Response (FFR), for example UK’s Dynamic Containment (DC), and Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) auctions. Such opportunities gave birth to robust business models for standalone storage assets. A prime example is the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the standalone energy storage concept matured, market players started looking at such assets from a complementary angle, that of co-location. Asset-level opportunities are centered around the idea that storage is primarily improving the performance – and therefore investment returns – of renewables through mitigating the risks deriving from their inherent intermittency nature. Profile shaping comprises a prime example, tackling the effects of cannibalization in the spot markets. The latest mega trend in the renewables-plus-storage sphere is in Hybrid PPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focal level of standalone storage asset is indeed grid services. However, when it comes to co-location, it’s pivotal to note that the two focal levels, grid- and asset-level opportunities, are not mutually exclusive. The combination of value creation from grid-level services alongside optimization of asset-level revenues encapsulates the driver behind the seeking of the colocation promising land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Value Stream&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Comments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing service&lt;/strong&gt; – accessible for SA and co-loc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Balancing authorities across Europe have the heavy responsibility of managing the physical aspect of the grid in real time, ensuring that there is a balance between supply and demand. Each country has different mechanisms in place to perform this task, creating services for various generations of technologies to monetize their contribution. It’s deemed a key route-to-market for storage assets.For example, in the UK - Operated by National Grid ESO, the Balancing Mechanism (BM) is the operator’s primary tool to balance supply and demand on the network in real time. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulated Markets&lt;/strong&gt; – FCR, FFR – an opportunity for SA projects, but also co-loc through optimization agreements for the storage part of the hybrid project&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short-term ancillary services enabled the number one competitive advantage of batteries to shine: fast response to grid needs in seconds. The nature of such services is to adapt their requirements depending on what is needed the most. For example, the cadence of auctions is adapting, and so are the rules of participation or the required volumes. Therefore, it’s not merely the strike price that is uncertain, but also the very existence of the service. The opportunistic thesis of such services put the seeds of a flexible mindset in storage asset owners and set the foundations of the famous ‘revenue stacking’ approach. Not one revenue stream is enough to create a long-term revenue plan to enable project or debt financing, so the aim has been to tap opportunities when they arise and feel comfortable with it. Optimization companies became some valuable partners, aiming to create as much revenue visibility as possible to their clients, and being in charge with the day-to-day bidding strategy of the assets through optimization agreements.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales in spot markets&lt;/strong&gt; – price arbitrage can be performed by SA while profile shaping with the same benefits can be achieved by co-loc assets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Outside the ‘services’ world, energy storage is also a participant in the wholesale spot markets. The aim is to take advantage of spot market volatility in the day-ahead markets, storing energy when spot prices are low, and selling at peak hours; aka price arbitrage and profile shaping for co-located assets. The wider the average daily wholesale spread, the better. Because such value stream is not a limited participation regulated service, it&amp;rsquo;s deemed as the most durable long-term revenue stream&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity Markets&lt;/strong&gt; – prime route to market offering some long-term revenue visibility through specific contracts. Can be accessed both from SA and co-loc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;In the UK - The scheme offers 1-15 year contracts for generation or demand-side response (DSR) units to financially incentivize their availability. The more sought after 15-year contracts are only reserved for new-build assets and comprised the success factor behind the first debt financings for battery storage assets. The upwards trajectory of the clearing price over the past auctions has surprised even the most optimistic observatory, rendering the revenue scheme a highly valuable both for new and existing assets. Othe EU countries - France, Ireland, Poland, Belgium, and Italy followed suit in setting up capacity mechanisms, which is deemed a large enabler of new storage assets to receive financing and connect to the grid. More countries are set to follow, with a prime example being Greece. The design, participation rules and payment mechanism differ from country to country, so participants need to confirm the bankability of such contracts in each region&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio level risk management&lt;/strong&gt; - the benefits of standalone storage assets and co-located ones can be equally quantified on a portfolio level&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;As renewables portfolios are growing, so are the risks that portfolios are exposed to. Price risk due to merchant exposure, capture risk due to cannibalization, and volume risk due to intermittent are some of the core ones. Flexible assets (such as energy storage or gas engines) and technologies (such as hydro) often help dilute risk exposure through diversification of capabilities. Such a value stream can only be measured through quantitative analysis either on a portfolio level (which could include standalone storage as well) or on individual asset level (only if storage and renewables are co-located) on an overall portfolio level, as it’s not a direct revenue stream such as the abovementioned. In a high pricing environment, imbalance risk for renewables also becomes notable, and through storage co-location imbalance costs could turn into revenue.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid PPA&lt;/strong&gt; - a contractual arrangement leveraging benefits both for the grid- and asset-level, only available to co-located assets&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;With a Hybrid PPA, the idea is to get the best of the two worlds: potentially generate revenues through grid services, while improving the investment returns of the renewable asset. The first financial-benefits touchpoint of considering co-locating a renewable asset with storage is the cost savings from the shared grid connection. Such cost savings, as well as saturation in the ancillary service markets, increased cannibalization risk for renewables and volatility in the wholesale markets incentivizing profile shaping of intermittent renewables, comprise factors driving market players to explore the co-location model overall. The maturity of tangible contractual arrangements and the emergence of Hybrid PPAs make the co-location consideration even more attractive. How the two assets will communicate will be dependent on the contractual details. With a Hybrid PPA, it’s possible to have a physical asset to manage the different types of PPA structures, practically turning storage into a physical hedge to complement the financial hedge of the renewable asset. At the same time, another option would be for the two assets to operate virtually independently, with a renewable PPA for the generation, and an optimization agreement for storage. Or adding a price premium to the energy produced from the renewable asset by valuing-in the flexibility which allows better risk management of the energy. &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue streams and use-cases for energy storage assets are multiple. Yes, energy storage is a Swiss-army knife multitasker, but eventually a decision needs to be made as to which business model will prove the one which best underpins each case. After the screening phase of available opportunities comes the time for modelling different scenarios, which we have identified as a core challenge in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The energy Security Scenario</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/global-energy/the-energy-security-scenario/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/global-energy/the-energy-security-scenario/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the Energy Security Scenarios report made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-security-scenarios.html&#34;&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell created 3 different energy scenarios - Waves, Islands and Sky 1.5. Each of these was built around possible approaches to climate change action as the world emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waves&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Waves&lt;/strong&gt; assumed that &lt;strong&gt;society&lt;/strong&gt; would &lt;strong&gt;prioritize repairing the economy&lt;/strong&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Waves&lt;/strong&gt; this focus on wealth pushes other societal and environmental pressures into the background, until their relative neglect provokes backlash reactions. This prompts rapid action to address global emissions but, even though the world achieves net-zero emissions, it comes too late to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement – to limit global average warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. &lt;strong&gt;This scenario shows late, but fast decarbonization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Islands&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Islands&lt;/strong&gt; assumed that &lt;strong&gt;security becomes the priority after COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;. In &lt;strong&gt;Islands&lt;/strong&gt; a new emphasis on nationalism threatens to dismantle the post-war geopolitical order and co-operation is limited. &lt;strong&gt;Competition between nations&lt;/strong&gt;, however, &lt;strong&gt;means technological advances&lt;/strong&gt;. Innovations are adopted, infrastructure is renewed and eventually the world does still reach net-zero emissions. &lt;strong&gt;The goal of the Paris Agreement is missed&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;This is late and slow decarbonization&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sky 1.5&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Sky 1.5&lt;/strong&gt; set a fixed goal of achieving the Paris Agreement and worked backwards from that point to explore how that could happen, considering the global situation in the early 2020s. Using this normative approach, in &lt;strong&gt;Sky 1.5&lt;/strong&gt; there is a post-pandemic focus on health and public well-being that results in high levels of co-operation towards mutually beneficial aims. This is accelerated decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the fragile post-Cold War global order cracked apart when Russia invaded Ukraine. There had already been worries about the supply of fossil-fuel energy, but the invasion made it clear how dependent society is, collectively, on traditional fuels like oil and gas. As nations respond, the world is collectively plunging into the security mindset that dominates &lt;strong&gt;Islands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new situation created 2 new sub scenarios:  &lt;strong&gt;Archipelagos&lt;/strong&gt; (as relevant to Islands) and &lt;strong&gt;Sky 2050&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Archipelagos&lt;/strong&gt; scenario seeks to follow a possible path from where the world was in 2022, while &lt;strong&gt;Sky 2050&lt;/strong&gt; starts with a desired outcome of: net-zero emissions by 2050 and global warming limited to 1.5°C by the end of the century and works backwards to explore how that outcome could be achieved. Working backwards to the realities of 2022 means that, while &lt;strong&gt;Sky 2050&lt;/strong&gt; does make many stretching assumptions, there is no expectation of halving emissions by 2030 as required by the Glasgow Climate Pact from COP26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze how countries will react to the recent geo-political changes, the report creates 4 types of country profile as in the below table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy prices volatility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Highly vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Highly vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Innovation Wins&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Highly vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;USA, UAE&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Great Wall of Change&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vulnerable&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;India&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YkeI59OV5dX91NX-E2-b-0b7Dj8OxY4yomvtKlcGEiEo8lawVkdx887aQXAg-4_LX2fCTQHW5x1XPCr5IV0rXxgMVX3x7SCztG2XN5MWjwDpGs4bTdcNMC07zMqKD06oNnIx7x9y5EXBa1FaGmaXDQ&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The need for energy security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Soviet Union, many had assumed that the forces of globalization and liberalization would prevail. Multiple developments seemed to support this view, including interconnected supply chains, international travel, and global cultural events. Other sources of optimism included the spread of social media, the unifying effects of digitalization and a shared concern over climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneath all of this, however, huge cracks have opened in the global order with growing doubts about the future of globalization itself. The signs pointing to trouble ahead have been present for some time. There has been a rise in nationalism, populism, and growing inequality within and between states, as well as a failure to deliver significant climate finance. The main examples are the trade war between the US and China, the Brexit and difficult relationships between Australia and China. With the war in Ukraine, the world has seen the threat to use nuclear weapons, the undercutting of international institutions such as the UN and interruptions in the supply of energy and food that are affecting the whole world. In the coming years, there appears to be little prospect of any return to the former world order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Paris Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the Paris agreement is:” Holding the increase  in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and  impacts of climate change”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How close the world is to reaching 1.5°C of warming is best described in terms of what is known as the “carbon budget”. The ongoing rise in global temperatures has a roughly linear relationship to the amount of CO2 emissions built up in the atmosphere over time. This means it is possible to estimate what sort of temperature rise is likely from a given amount of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Knowing how much CO2 results in each temperature rise, means society can estimate how much CO2 can be emitted before the world hits 1.5°C of warming. This is the carbon budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dynamics around the carbon budget leave the world with only one option if it is to achieve 1.5°C. If society exceeds its budget, then it must make up the difference later. It can do so by removing CO2 from the atmosphere to balance the excess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathways which exceed the carbon budget but then make up the difference in subsequent years, by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, are referred to as overshoot pathways. In these pathways the global average surface temperature overshoots the desired goal, but eventually returns to that level. &lt;strong&gt;Sky 2050&lt;/strong&gt; is an overshoot pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overshoot pathway leads to a conclusion that carbon capture, carbon removal and carbon storage will have to play important roles.  This set of technologies comes in many shapes and forms as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial CO2 capture at a facility such as a chemical plant. This involves passing a stream of waste gases over a material which binds to the CO2 and prevents it from reaching the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere (DAC).  This involves sucking air over a material which binds to the CO2 and removes it from the atmosphere. Very large quantities of air must be processed for this technology to deliver a meaningful result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geological storage takes the CO2 captured at an industrial facility, or through DAC, and places it in a geological formation some 2-3 km below the surface. This is permanent storage away from the atmosphere and so removes the CO2 from the natural carbon cycle. In this way it either compensates for, or prevents, CO2 from being added to the atmosphere by the combustion of fossil fuels or chemical processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the carbon held in the land system through activities such as reforestation and soil restoration.  This removes CO2 from the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing CO2 from power plants fueled by biomass and permanently storing the CO2. This is known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It indirectly removes CO2 from the atmosphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leapfrog development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important element of securing the goal of the Paris Agreement is an effective leapfrog over the fossil fuel era – cutting out the use of fossil fuels entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nations have the potential to leapfrog because they start from such an energy poor position. Rather than fueling their countries’ development by burning fossil fuels, they move directly into widespread electrification and low-carbon sources of electricity generation. Apart from global climate benefits, bringing forward electrification with renewables has significant domestic advantages. These benefits include improving local environmental quality, increasing energy access, and reducing import dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Sky 2050&lt;/strong&gt;, and to a large extent in &lt;strong&gt;Archipelagos&lt;/strong&gt;, the countries do not enter the fossil fuel era to the extent that others have (although many still consume biomass, such as wood) and instead move straight to electricity-based energy technologies such as wind and solar. They adopt these technologies at only a slightly slower rate than nations of other archetypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful leapfrog – which involves electrifying the economy, accelerating the adoption of renewables, and investing to integrate these new energy sources into each nation’s energy system – requires three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful effective policies&lt;/strong&gt; - These policies incentivize electricity use sector-by-sector (such as transport, buildings, and industry). The policies also work to decarbonize the power sector and include both targets for the uptake of renewables and subsidies to support their adoption. The world is already seeing action of this nature starting in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. In addition, government policies remove institutional and regulatory barriers to renewable deployment. One example would be to ensure that the low cost of renewable electricity is reflected in the prices that customers pay. Another example would be to speed up planning processes and regulation reforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worldwide renewable acceleration&lt;/strong&gt; - Critically, the cost of renewables must fall, alongside the cost of technologies that integrate intermittent renewable generation into the power grid. Falling costs can drive further deployment and improve confidence in renewables-based systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sufficient Finance&lt;/strong&gt; - This means governments and international institutions, such as multilateral development banks, need to find innovative ways of working with private sources of capital to provide adequate funding streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of leapfrog development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential power of the leapfrog phenomenon tends to be overlooked. In part this is because most forecasts have systematically failed to anticipate the declining cost of solar and wind generation. This failure means the speed of renewable deployment is also typically underestimated. In addition, not enough weight has been given to the cost reductions that are likely as more and more renewable systems are rolled out around the world: society will learn as it goes and find better and more efficient systems and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sectoral and societal trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The chemical industry transforms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since World War II, the demand for non-energy products made from oil – such as petrochemicals (including plastics), fertilizer and bitumen – has grown steadily. The world’s use of chemicals is extremely diverse: they are used in many products that provide comfort and convenience, including packaging, clothing, home insulation and foams for furniture. Less obvious to many, they are also essential to products used for sanitation, preserving foods, treating diseases, and increasing crop yields. Innovation into new advanced materials – and new ways of using them – is constantly increasing the usefulness of these products in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So central have non-energy oil products become that demand for them has grown at the same pace as the global economy (in terms of GDP). Demand growth in developing countries runs even faster than GDP, as lifestyles catch up. In rich countries, the evidence suggests that per capita demand is slowing down and may have reached a peak for some products. However, predictions of a shift to less material-intensive growth have not yet occurred at large scale. Attempts to move towards traditional materials like metal and glass often run into the challenge that they can come with higher carbon footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With rising incomes in non-OECD countries, demand continues to grow. Growth in richer countries starts to plateau, albeit at different rates. Plastic waste in nature, growing concerns on microplastics and the industry’s increasing share of global CO2 emissions led to a wide range of environmental challenges. Addressing these is not easy for the industry: it is a highly complex sector due to its diversity across consumers, products, technology, by-products, and international trade. The industry’s production facilities can also last 60 years or more, often locking in old technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing share of bio-based chemicals emerges through a mix of new policies and a higher willingness from consumers to pay a premium. Many such chemicals will be based on different molecules than those that emerged from the oil-based feedstocks that are common today. In addition to bio-based feedstocks, there is a move to bio-degradable products. These are focused on applications where the lack of recycling options means there is a high risk of these products remaining for a long time in nature, such as microplastics. The fertilizer industry is the first to move at large scale to products made from green hydrogen – made by using renewable energy to split water molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security-first mindset that dominates following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, combined with the high price of energy, brings energy efficiency to the top of agendas. This is a factor across both scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fossil fuels dominate the energy mix, energy use drives emissions. This means that limiting the use of energy can help limit emissions. In addition, by keeping overall energy use as low as possible the growth of new energy supplies can displace a greater proportion of the legacy fossil fuel-based energy system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy use can be limited by two methods. Firstly, people can choose to use energy in more efficient ways – by driving smoothly and limiting speed, for example. Secondly, products and processes that use energy can be designed to use it more effectively – cars can be designed so that the amount of energy they need to drive 1 kilometer comes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles convert around 80% of the energy they take from the grid into power at the wheels. This means that if the electricity for an electric vehicle comes from a renewable energy installation, which generates electricity without losing energy through combustion, the overall efficiency of the system is around 80%. The exact figure depends on transmission losses, electricity storage and other factors. The picture is less good for electric vehicles if the electricity is produced by burning coal or natural gas. If fossil fuels are the source of the grid power going into an electric car, the overall efficiency is around 25-40%. Conventional internal combustion engine vehicles convert less than a third of the energy stored in petrol to power at the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond electric vehicles, other major step changes involve appliances and heating in homes and buildings. While most appliances are already electric, moving from cooking on flames to electric cooking significantly improves efficiency. Natural gas cooking hobs are about 40% efficient, whereas whole electric-coil and standard smooth-top electric hobs are around 70% efficient. The latest induction hobs are more than 80% efficient. Cooking with biomass, like wood, is likely to be less efficient than natural gas, although in certain circumstances where home heating is incorporated, this may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the efficient use of energy to heat or cool buildings can be improved both as a step change – by introducing technologies such as heat pumps – and progressively through an active insulation program. Under ideal conditions, an electric heat pump can transfer 300% more energy than it consumes. In contrast, a high efficiency gas furnace is about 95% efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A transport revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Road passenger&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of road passenger vehicles shifts rapidly to a single solution: battery electric power. No space emerges for any other solution as manufacturers abandon the development, then production, of vehicles with an internal combustion engine. Business models throughout the passenger transport sector rapidly move towards electric vehicles. The energy efficiency of electric vehicles means that total energy demand in this sector falls even as vehicle numbers grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Road freight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The road freight transition also includes a shift towards electricity. This starts with light vans, municipal trucks, and service vehicles, before spreading into medium-haul trucks. But the high-energy density of molecular fuels remains critical for very heavy-duty applications and long-haul, high-capacity road freight. Biofuels and, much later, synthetic fuels based on CO2 directly captured from the air, contribute to a lower carbon footprint for the sector. From the late 2020s, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles emerge as the preferred solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aviation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aviation remains reliant on liquid hydrocarbon fuels, with no alternatives emerging at scale until the 2040s. Battery electric planes – with the electricity used to turn propellers – make their first appearance in the 2030s on very short commuter routes. Jet turbine planes, burning hydrogen as a fuel, start to appear on medium-haul routes in the 2040s. The major shift comes in the formulation of jet fuel, with sustainable aviation fuels taking market share from the 2020s onwards. This starts with biofuel being mixed with kerosene. In time, the cost of capturing CO2 from the air using direct air capture (DAC) fall, and this allows for the cost-effective production of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the 2020s and 2030s, the shipping industry experiments with a number of options to reduce its carbon footprint. These include biofuels such as bio-methanol, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen (either directly using hydrogen as a fuel, or in the form of ammonia). In the mid-2030s, however, the industry settles firmly on the hydrogen-based solution, working in close co-operation with shipbuilders, fuel suppliers and key bunkering ports. Almost all ships constructed after this time have fuel systems that use either hydrogen or ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ERCOT – Energy storage market</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/energy-storage-market/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/energy-storage-market/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background on ERCOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT manages the flow of electric power on the Texas Interconnection that supplies power to more than 26 million Texas customers – representing approximately 90% of the state&amp;rsquo;s electric load. As the independent system operator for the region, ERCOT dispatches more than 680 generating resources to reliably deliver power to customers over more than 46,500 miles of transmission lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the markets in ERCOT is essential because those markets coordinate the commitment and dispatch of generating resources, manage flows over the transmission network, and establish prices that guide participants’ decisions in the short and long-term. Although natural gas prices fell 23% on average in 2019, causing electricity prices to fall in most of the country’s wholesale markets, real-time energy prices rose 32% in ERCOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load in 2019&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Total ERCOT load in 2019 increased 2% from 2018, an overall increase of 880 MW per hour on average. In June, July and August, there was a 6% increase from 2018 in the number of cooling degree days in Houston. Cooling degree days is a metric that is highly correlated with summer loads. Summer conditions in 2019 produced a new record peak load of 74,820 MW on August 12, 2019, surpassing the previous record of 73,473 MW on July 19, 2018. The South, Houston, and West zones experienced varying increases in peak load ranging from 0.4% in the South zone to more than 11% in the West zone. In contrast, the North Zone consumed 3.4% less at peak than in 2018. The level of peak demand is important because it affects the probability and frequency of shortage conditions, as well as the quantity of resources needed to maintain reliability. However, in recent years, peak net load (demand minus renewable resource output) has become more highly correlated with the probability of a shortage condition. Generating Resources Approximately 4.9 gigawatts (GW) of new generation resources came online in 2019, the bulk of which were wind resources with total nameplate capacity level of 4.7 GW, and an effective peak serving capacity of approximately 1,250 MW. The remaining capacity additions were: 80 MW of combustion turbines, 50 MW of solar resources, and 30 MW of storage resources. There were 550 MW of retirements in 2019: 470 MW of coal and 80 MW of wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Generation levels in 2019 were mixed by the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The generation share from wind has increased every year since 2004, reaching almost 20% of the annual generation in 2019, up from 19% in 2018 and 17% in 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The share of generation from coal continues to fall, down to just over 20% in 2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The falling coal output was replaced by natural gas generation, which increased from 44% in 2018 to 47% in 2019.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect these trends to continue because of historically low natural gas prices, making gas fired resources increasingly more economic than coal resources, and the continued growth of zero fuel cost resources, like wind and solar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind Output&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment in wind resources has continued to increase over the past few years in ERCOT. The amount of wind capacity installed in ERCOT approached 27 GW at the end of 2019. ERCOT continued to set new records for peak wind output in 2019. On January 21, wind resources produced a record 19,672 MW instantaneously. On November 26, wind provided nearly 58% of the total load, also a new record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing levels of wind resources in ERCOT have important implications for the net load served by the non-wind fleet of resources. Net load is defined as the system load less wind and solar production, and the range is getting larger. The difference between highest and lowest net load MWs was even more pronounced in 2019 than 2018. Wind output displaces the total load needed to consume the minimum production from baseload units, particularly at night. The output of wind resources results in only modest reductions of the net load relative to the actual load during the highest demand hours, but much larger reductions in the net load in the other hours. The importance of net load in ERCOT was illustrated during the week of August 12 when the highest prices did not correspond to the highest loads, but rather to the highest net loads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERCOT UNIQUE MARKET STRUCTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas’ unique electric market structure facilitates choices by energy customers and producers that contribute to grid reliability in ways that differ from every other region in North America. ERCOT relies on market competition and price signals to assure that real-time electric supply matches demand. Some question the wisdom of trusting an “energy-only” market and issue warnings every summer of impending blackouts in the August heat. To date, however, the combination of high prices and falling resource costs have increased the amount of generation installed in ERCOT and the availability of the generation fleet during tight market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT’s experience has shown that Texas’ market structure supports electric reliability in an economically effective and environmentally sustainable way. Over the past 18 years, wholesale electric competition within ERCOT system has attracted extensive new investment in renewable and fossil resources, energy storage and price-responsive demand. These investments have leveraged technology innovations, including the replacement of inefficient natural gas and coal plants with highly efficient natural gas and extensive wind and solar generation capacity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed energy resources, such as photovoltaic solar and storage, and demand-side measures, such as energy efficiency and automated and price-responsive demand, can respond to prices as well as to grid management signals. In a time of rapid demand growth and uncertain supply, these assets should be used to de-risk the electric system by reducing peak load and ancillary service needs (fast ramping, in particular). This reduces the burden and cost of assuring adequate supply and flexibility services and protects customers while enhancing system and community resilience. All of these resources can be coordinated and integrated with advanced monitoring, forecasting, analytics, communications, and controls to integrate and balance demand with supply for reliable, affordable and sustainable electric service&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers and sellers within ERCOT use bilateral contracts and energy-only spot markets with scarcity pricing for electricity transactions. Power producers in ERCOT only earn revenue from the sale of energy and ancillary services. They decide whether to keep or retire existing plants and build new plants based on the competitiveness of those plants relative to prevailing energy prices and forward market prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves are capacity that is available to be used, but will not provide energy until called on by its owner or the grid operator. Unlike other regions, ERCOT does not require a mandatory reserve margin.27 28 Rather, reserve margins in ERCOT fluctuate based on generators’ decisions about whether to build or shutter a power plant in the region, and customers’ decisions on how much energy to consume and when. Both supply and demand decisions are driven by economic price signals: low real-time prices indicate that energy is cheap and over-supplied, while high prices mean that energy is valuable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of North America’s electric operating regions have planning reserve margins (the proportion of projected availability of anticipated electric generation and load management resources to meet forecasted customer peak load) ranging from 13 to 97% over projected customer load.29 Customers in these regions essentially make advance payments, whether through capacity market charges or through rate-base payments to bundled utilities, to assure the availability of what policymakers deem to be adequate capacity levels during annual or seasonal peak periods. In these regions, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) limits shortage- or scarcity-related energy price caps to $2,000 per MWh, and price spikes in those regions are viewed as market problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise for setting planning reserve margins has historically been that grid operators should have sufficient generation in excess of load that generation shortfalls (rotating outages or full blackouts) should occur no more than one day in every ten years. These outdated assumptions ignore the fact that demand is no longer absolute; many customers now have the capability to manage their electricity usage through active or automated means in response to price signals or grid conditions. Furthermore, since over 99% of actual customer outage minutes occur due to failures of transmission and distribution (mostly affected by severe weather events)30 rather than insufficient generation, it is likely that incremental additions of generation capacity will have little impact on customer outages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices method in ERCOT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since Ercot is energy only market, there is no capacity compensation for electricity generators. To cover this lack of compensation and to encourage new investments of new generators , from any kind, the market desgn in a way that in times of shortage or the the load get closer to the maximum market capacity , genreators are getting paid very high price per hour, with a cap of $9,000/MWh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These&lt;/strong&gt; High prices signal to new generators that they can recover their operating and capital costs. They also motivate retail electric providers to sign contracts directly with generators to lock in predictable prices and shield themselves against future price spikes and contract with retail customers to provide future demand response when needed. And power contracts help generators finance new plants and demand aggregators finance new demand management projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The demand curves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effective economic market there is an active supply and demand curves, wherein suppliers can decide how much of the product they want to offer at any price, and customers can decide how much they want to consume at each price. The interaction of these supply and demand curves sets product prices. In markets where many active suppliers compete, such as ERCOT, the market-clearing price will be a time-series of short-run marginal costs, reflecting the cost to produce the last unit consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic microeconomic theory holds that rational consumers will want more of something if its price decreases and buy less of it when its price rises. In the case of electricity, however, some electricity uses (such as medical ventilators or an active integrated circuit production line), are so valuable that the user is indifferent to the price of electricity and will consume the same amount at almost any price. Traditionally, most electricity consumers have no real-time information about the price of electricity because they are buying flat-priced energy, and their providers never reveal either the real-time cost of electricity or the amount of electricity that the user is consuming. These limitations create a steep, near-vertical demand curve that is relatively unresponsive to rising electricity prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT’s demand curve has become fairly price-responsive because many customers have the opportunity to access information on their electricity usage and access to retail electric rate options that encourage using less electricity in times when it costs the most. ERCOT estimates that during the peak load week of August 12-16, 2019, when load was very high and three actual or near-critical peak loads occurred, at least 17% of load was exposed to real-time energy prices, 58 and customers reduced their peak load use by 1,600 up to 3,100 MW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of ERCOT’s electric meters are advanced meters that measure and record use data in 15-minute or faster time increments.60 This means that it is theoretically possible for almost 7 million ERCOT electricity users to monitor their electricity usage in near-real time. 61 Texas regulators are presently considering rule changes for real-time electricity use data access that could greatly compromise customers’ and third-party energy managers’ ability to access real-time electricity usage data and act upon that information promptly with price- or use-responsive energy management actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT has robust retail competition. About 70% of electric residential, commercial and industrial customers have left their default or distribution-affiliated electric provider for service from 116 competitive Retail Electric Providers (REP).63 In any month in 2018, between 275,000 to 440,000 ERCOT customers shopped for a new REP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many electricity customers can participate in retail time-of-use rates and demand response programs. REPs in ERCOT offer over 300 rate plans and products; 64 while many rate plans offer fixed rates (a single price per kWh over an extended contract period), others offer time-varying priced electric rates. These include time-of-use and real-time-pricing rates that increase prices during late afternoon peak use periods, critical peak pricing, and options that offer “free nights and weekends” programs that incent customers to move their energy use away from costly daytime energy use to times when abundant, cheap wind energy is available.65 In 2018, 1,254,734 ERCOT end-use customers were enrolled in some type of retail time-of-use or price-responsive rate, representing up to 1,415 MW of load that might respond to some form of time-based electric retail prices.66 These include REP customers and customers served by municipal utilities, such as Austin and San Antonio, that are not open to retail competition. Such retail programs affect how much ERCOT electric customers, in aggregate, are willing to pay for electricity at various times and price levels and thus affect market-clearing electric prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT’s transmission and distribution utilities also offer limited load management programs. Many programs pay end-use customers to take a limited number of curtailments on summer weekday afternoons. Over 250 MW of load participates in these programs. These curtailments are dispatched for grid operational reasons and may be deployed during a Level 2 Energy Emergency Alert.68 Some municipal and cooperative utilities also deploy Conservation Voltage Reduction to lower voltage and thus lower demand by 1-3% along selected feeders during peak load conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “4CP” mechanism is one of the most impactful demand-shifting mechanisms in ERCOT. Cost allocation rules allocate ERCOT-wide transmission costs based on distribution utilities’ and large customers’ individual electric demands on the four 15- minute intervals when ERCOT’s maximum coincident peak (CP) demand occurs. Therefore, many of ERCOT’s REPs and portfolio managers alert customers when a peak demand day is expected so the customer can cut its energy usage to reduce the level of the next year’s demand charges. This helps the REP manage its energy portfolio and costs. ERCOT estimates that about 2,475 large customers cut or shifted their peak demand by between 920 and 1,781 MW during 4CP and “near-4CP” events in 2018, materially changing the level and time of peak demand.70 Estimated 4CP demand in August 2019 ranged from 946 to 2,136 MW on the maximum load and near-coincident peak days.71 This demand avoidance is not a response to energy prices, but rather an effort to avoid demand charges (presently set at $53.58 per kW for transmission cost recovery). 4CP days occur on the hottest days of the year but are not often coincident with the highest energy prices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large industrial customers and aggregated smaller customers have the option of participating in ERCOT’s ancillary and reliability services markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive Reserve Service (RRS) is the dominant option for loads. Loads controlled by high-set under-frequency relays are paid if they are called to provide frequency response. Over 3,000 MW of load is qualified to provide RRS. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation Service and Fast Responding Regulation Service are attractive options for storage resources, which act as generation resources when injecting energy into the grid and controllable load resources when charging. The number of resources qualified to provide these services will increase as ERCOT’s installed storage capacity grows. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Spinning Reserve options for load resource participation are under development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ERCOT can call on Emergency Response Service (ERS) customers to meet grid emergency conditions. ERS has 10-minute and 30-minute ramp requirements that can be provided by loads and small generators. The August 15, 2019 ERS deployment delivered almost 750 MW of load reduction over a 1.5 hour period, exceeding the required reduction level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERCOT issues Energy Emergency Alerts (EEAs) when remaining operating reserves fall below 2,300 MW. An EEA triggers ERCOT’s use of various levels of Emergency Response Services, REP and other calls for voluntary conservation, and actions such as distribution utility implementation of Conservation Voltage Reduction. Two EEAs were issued during August 2019. In each case, a suite of actions taken on the customer side – response to 4CP signals, distributed generation and customer energy management – and REP demand response chasing high prices and EEA-associated voluntary conservation produced load reductions from 1,800 up to up 3,100 MW during peak hours. 74 These load reductions reduced electricity demand by over 3% in some of the highest-priced hours of 2019 and were essential for maintaining reliable grid operation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer-owned distributed energy resources also affect ERCOT customer demand and load shapes. ERCOT registers larger facilities (1 to 10 MW) and cannot effectively track unregistered (smaller than 1 MW) distributed generation located on a customer’s site. At the end of 2018, ERCOT had over 1,300 MW of energy storage and solar, diesel, natural gas, and other generation connected at the distribution level, growing at over 60% per year. 76 Distributed solar PV alone is forecasted to reach 2,580 MW by 2024.77 ERCOT estimates that distributed generation across ERCOT increased net output by 150 to 200 MW during the August 12-16, 2019 peak periods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the factors and programs above affect the balance between electricity supply and demand in ERCOT and the resulting market equilibrium prices, regardless of whether the demand or distributed resources are actively bid into the market or operate quietly behind the customers’ meter or the REP’s portfolio. Any non-market measure that affects the level of demand (such as population growth and temperature levels) and the availability of substitutes (such as energy efficiency and photovoltaics), customer price elasticity (such as through demand response) influences the equilibrium market price. If many customers gain the capability to see and respond to real-time electricity prices, their actions will affect market-clearing electricity prices. Though it is appealing to have demand and DER resources show up as active, quasi-supply bidders in the spot market, the rules and high entry costs of becoming active market participants may dissuade such participation and limit demand and distributed generation initiatives. This could harm, rather than enhance, ERCOT’s system reliability and resilience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Storage in Texas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Nearly 24GW of wind capacity, ERCOT has seen the most power development in the US and is beginning to see an increasing push to add solar generation driven by tax credit availability rather than a state renewable portfolio standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 90% of the Texas load is served through the ERCOT market, which set a record peak demand of 74MW on August 2019. More than 25% of generating capacity in ERCOT, as of January 2019 came from intermittent resources – 23.4% from wind and 2.1% from solar. The current interconnection queue provides an insight about the future generation which will be mixed by core intermittent, with 59 MW of solar accounting for 54% of the queue, 36,000 of wind accounting for 33% of the queue, 10GW of gas representing 9% of the queue, and 4GW of battery storage representing 4% of the queue. With this queues status and plan development, ERCOT will look like a ripe market for the storage energy developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increase in less-expensive renewables sources comes a decrease in power prices. ERCOT West Hub on-peak real-time locational marginal prices have fallen into negative territory in five out of the last seven years as most wind – and more recently solar- is added across the sprawling open fields of west Texas. West Hub real-time prices have already fallen as low as negative 3 cents/MWh so far this year, something that typically happens later in the year. In 2016, West Hub real-time prices fell as low as negative $9.68/MWh in Q4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy storage capabilities provide a wide range of services to the grid in a single compact package. Storage deployment is still in the early stages relative to wind and solar. The main revenue streams that are the most attractive for battery energy storage project are the capacity, ancillary services and energy. However, the ERCOT market is an energy only market, so the capacity portion is not part of the formula to battery energy storage projects in ERCOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the 2 other portions are not so beneficial yet for energy storage projects in TX. Texas does have market for FR, and some storage projects are participating. But this is all merchant too, and the returns are nowhere near as solid as in the early days of PJM’s battery boom. The small market is already getting saturated. That pattern had repeated everywhere else. Looking at the energy market structure and behavior, it looks like that the potential is there, with the ability of prices getting up to $9,000/MWh. The problem that the market is not too volatile, and the arbitrage opportunities are still low.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Battery energy storage use cases and outcome revenues streams</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/battery-energy-storage-use-cases/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/energy-storage/battery-energy-storage-use-cases/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy storage has been around for a long time. Alessandro Volta invented the battery in 1800. Until recently, Batteries used to provide power at those locations where no grid connection is present, like for starter motors cars, mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices or for emergency power or computer servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the last innovations in the energy storage industry, it is clear that energy storage technology and solutions will become crucial element in our life. The ongoing transition we are experiencing with the higher shares of renewable and intermittent energy resources and distributed generation applications requires ways to store and release energy when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy storage has the potential to provide a wide array of benefits to the electric grid, and states across the country are increasingly considering statewide targets for the deployment of energy storage resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 7 states who adopted storage procurement targets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;California – 1,325MW by 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevada – 1,000 MW by 2030&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oregon – 10 MWh by 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NY – 3,000 MW by 2030&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MA – 1,000 MWh by 2025&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NJ – 2,000 MW by 2030&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VA- 3,100 MW by 2035.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These procurement targets, set a confidence among market developers and financial institutes through their approach to develop and support the energy storage market in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several use cases for energy storage divided mainly to ancillary services and load shifting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancillary services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequency control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voltage control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black start energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load shifting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hedge of energy sells commitment breach penalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy arbitrage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule stabilization – to avoid ramping up costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity reserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peak shaving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy storage cases can also be seen through major consumers groups &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage industry has been boosted by few successful completion of  non-recourse battery energy storage project financings and the increase in utility procurement of battery storage projects and products, as seen above. Private developers have recently closed hundreds of millions of dollars of financings for large battery projects. Moreover, utilities have procured hundreds of megawatts of utility-owned battery projects through EPC, BOT or similar contractual acquisition structures and have executed numerous contracts for battery project services and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful development and financing of any type of energy or infrastructure project requires many different building blocks, including site control, permits, interconnection, regulatory exemptions, EPC, O&amp;amp;M, PPA/offtake revenue contracts, and others. Although each of these is important, the most critical issue is to ensure the viability and finance-ability of battery storage projects arise primarily in the area of dependable offtake revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery Storage Revenue streams:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity&lt;/strong&gt; – Energy storage projects could provide a utility an obligation for the projects readiness to charge/discharge from/to the grid when such services will be called by the utility. For this on-call service, the project will get paid based on a fix amount of dollars per MW, according to the project commitment. This structure is used in PJM and CAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tolling agreement&lt;/strong&gt; – The energy storage tolling agreement provides the off taker (typically a utility) with capacity, energy and other products generated by a grid-connected, stand-alone battery project. As the “seller” under the agreement, the project sponsor is responsible for developing, owning, operating and maintaining the battery project, and retains technical operational control of the battery. As the “buyer” under the Agreement, the off taker typically exercises full authority to charge and discharge the battery, subject to the battery’s operating limitations and other agreed dispatch parameters. In addition, the off taker typically pays for and delivers all charging energy from the grid to the battery and acts as “scheduling coordinator” or “market participant” for the battery in managing its scheduling arrangements. The off taker pays the project sponsor a fixed (usually monthly) capacity charge for its right to utilize the battery’s capacity, and frequently a variable operating or “energy” charge for dispatches instructed by the off taker. The capacity charge may be subject to reduction for decreases in capacity, availability or efficiency of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancillary Services&lt;/strong&gt; – Ancillary services are used by the grid operator to balance the frequency of the grid and ensure there is enough reserve capacity to meet unexpected stress events. The project sells ancillary services to the market at spot price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand response&lt;/strong&gt; – various energy storage projects can aggregate into one source, like a virtual power plant, and provide the grid demand-response service in exchange for fixed payments. Demand response means shedding behind the meter load in response to a signal from the utility. The battery or other storage device may be used by customers for other applications when not providing demand response services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand charge&lt;/strong&gt; – also known as peak shaving. High electricity co consumers are paying extra charges on their electricity load at peak days. To avoid those charges, customers can have another source of energy (for the peak moments only) like a battery. That way, the customer will save the peak demand charges and the economic benefits will be split between the customer and the battery provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Arbitrage&lt;/strong&gt; - simple as it sounds, an energy storage facility can use energy prices fluctuation and charge the battery when cost of electricity is low and discharge the battery and sell electricity when cost of electricity is high&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Abstracting the complexity of microgrids</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/microgrid/abstracting-the-complexity-of-microgrids/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/microgrid/abstracting-the-complexity-of-microgrids/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not secret anymore, that the way we are using energy cause damage to our planet. In 2021 we expect to consume 40x energy compare to 1900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Due to the global warming we will demand 3x energy by 2050 compare today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To adjust to the new energy reality, organizations are under growing pressure to participate in the globalization effort reduce emission and avoid global warming. Over the past decades the cost of electricity distribution increased by 50% in the U.S. In order to confront the global warming, states are setting mandates for 100% cleat electricity , covering nearly one-third of the U.S.C&amp;amp;I and companies are forecasted to see over $100B in annual losses from power outages through the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the solution will be to bring electric and digital together – Microgrid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;DOE  a microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional  centralized utility grid is a big interconnected network that takes energy from large far away energy generation paltforms and transmit it over long distances to consumers.As technologies andpolitics continue to evolve, communities and business can choose to supply their own enrgy locally by building their own microgrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As energy become vermore critical n our daily live, Microgrids will enable us to shift from central power generation to local, flexible and reliable form of sustainable power and thermal energy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microgrids won’t be a core part of the clean-energy transition until they serve all three grid needs — greener, more reliable, more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, most microgrids around the world rely on diesel generators, which are polluting and loud, so they’re not very green. (In the US, the primary sources are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/microgrid-market&#34;&gt;CHP and natural gas&lt;/a&gt;.) They only turn on once the grid is down, so they don’t help with day-to-day reliability. Of the three grid needs, most serve only resilience, and only for those lucky enough to be connected to one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As basic as most of them are today, microgrids hold great promise for the future. Technology is rapidly expanding the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electricity use is becoming more controllable and adaptable, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.greentechmedia.com/squared/dispatches-from-the-grid-edge/how-billions-of-iot-enabled-devices-could-change-the-grid-edge&#34;&gt;as every system and appliance learns to communicate over the internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small-scale and community-scale electricity generators are getting cheaper, cleaner, and more diverse; they now include solar panels, small-scale wind, efficient natural gas generators and fuel cells, CHP, and more.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy storage is also becoming cheaper and more diverse, from various kinds of batteries and fuel cells to thermal storage in hot water or ice. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://microgridknowledge.com/front-of-meter-microgrid-sonoma/&#34;&gt;The Stone Edge Farm microgrid in Sonoma boasts five separate forms of storage&lt;/a&gt;.) Every bit of new storage helps to smooth out the variations in solar and wind, allowing more to be absorbed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software, AI, and machine learning are enabling intelligent integration of all these diverse resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart design and software can create microgrids specifically designed to integrate distributed renewable energy, or microgrids designed to provide “six nines” (99.9999 percent) reliability, or microgrids designed for maximum resilience. There are even “nested” microgrids within microgrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed microgrids present a business model challenge to investor-owned utilities and transmission systems as these microgrids are increasingly able to compete in wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary services markets, and displace utility loads and utility revenue. Utilities are increasingly building their own renewable generation, often with a microgrid architecture to meet the demands for new generation and grid reliability required by regulators, but utilities are being asked to do much more than compete with distributed power. ISOs, RTOs, utilities, and regulators are working to transition electric grids to allow fair competition to provide reliable low-cost power. Utilities were once a natural monopoly. Now, they are being asked to help build out an efficient, workable, low-carbon distributed system, and figure out how they will fit into that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arcweb.com/&#34;&gt;ARC Advisory Group &lt;/a&gt;market studies of microgrids and grid-scale battery suppliers show these markets growing, with large compound annual growth rates. The traditional grid hardware, software, and service providers are very strong suppliers to the microgrid market. Many smaller suppliers have also emerged in the nano-grid market for residential PV systems with battery storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.powermag.com/energy-at-a-cellular-level-battery-storage-shows-plenty-of-power/&#34;&gt;lithium batteries have established a strong lead in the market for grid-scale batteries&lt;/a&gt; in part by the economies of scale. PJM Interconnection, demonstrated that lithium batteries can be used effectively for grid frequency control applications. As the markets for frequency control get saturated, there are many other markets where new grid-scale battery applications can compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a grid-scale battery with a modern power inverter/converter is an instant microgrid all by itself. Coupling microgrids to meet demand-side flexibility is a problem that must be solved. This will require new technology, new regulations, and new business models, and the smart grid to perform new tasks it was designed to do but has never done before at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI’s) issued in 2018 &lt;a href=&#34;http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/PublicMeetingMaterials/ee/USNEA_FinalReport_Executive_Summary_3002013582.pdf&#34;&gt;the U.S. National Electrification Assessment report&lt;/a&gt; , describing the idea that effective integration of energy supplier and user networks can and will lead to more reliable, flexible, and affordable energy services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power industry has always had the choice to integrate the user side of the grid to reduce peaks and smooth loads. Pumped-hydro storage was built in some cases to avoid cycling nuclear plants; the new distributed generation grid also needs that type of operational flexibility. So, what is different now that we need to integrate to the demand side? The difference is the system now has unprecedented network communications, digital technologies, mobile devices, smart meters, smart grid standards, and the electrification of transport and building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). These enable far greater flexibility to adjust demand on the user side of the grid. While this is arguably the most complex systems integration problem society faces today, ARC believes all the technology needed to succeed is in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While natural gas has an important role to play, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-clean-energy-portfolios/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economics of Clean Energy Portfolios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—published in 2018 by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)—warns of the high costs of a rush to gas generation. RMI provides business-model research to show renewable energy, including wind and solar, and distributed energy resources, including batteries, have fallen precipitously in price in the last 10 years. At the same time, developer and grid operator experience with these resources has demonstrated their ability to provide many, if not all, of the grid services typically provided by thermal power plants. This renewable electric generation is a major driving force for microgrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric grids are increasingly deregulated, but deregulation has a long way to go before small players can compete in all the markets where large generators or large loads currently do. Grids are already using local marginal pricing (LMP) to drive generation and loads, but this price is meaningless to small users. Even with smart meters and smart grid standards, small microgrids and nano-grid operations have not reached the point where they are driven by the real-time local price of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More homes will have solar PV and batteries, electric vehicles, heat pump hot water heaters, and electric-driven HVAC systems, but how can homeowners with flexible loads will provide services to the grid?  How can they be compensated for the grid services they might provide? PV battery systems do not support power export, electric vehicles do not support V2G (vehicle-to-grid) or remote charging applications, heat pump hot water heaters do not support scheduling, end-users cannot buy Wi-Fi enabled residential circuit breakers that support grid price scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silent Cyber – What to look for</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/risk-managment/silent-cyberwhat-to-look-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:43:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/risk-managment/silent-cyberwhat-to-look-for/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As the world continues to advance technologically, the number of cyber-attacks has increased at an alarming rate. A study done by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/security/cost-cybercrime-study&#34;&gt;Accenture and the Ponemon Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which researched 355 companies in 16 different industries, revealed that between 2014-2018 security breaches have increased by 67%, with an 11% increase in 2018 alone. On their third annual state of cyber resilience, Accenture and the Pnemone institute, found that 10.9% of organizations’ IT budget spent on cyber security, only 60% of the business ecosystem is protected by the cybersecurity program and 40% breaches reached out via this tour. 69% of the organizations in the study agree staying ahead of attackers is constant battle and the cost is unsustainable. Since 2013, companies such as Yahoo!, Marriot, MySpace, Under Armour, Equifax, Ebay, Target, and LinkedIn have each suffered data breaches of at least 100 million user accounts, with Yahoo! being the highest, at 3.5 billion accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs incurred by victims of cyber-attacks have increased exponentially. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/&#34;&gt;The average cost&lt;/a&gt; of a single cyber-attack now exceeds $1 million, and the average cost of a malware attack is $2.4 million. Total damages for cyber-crime are projected to reach $6 trillion annually by 2021. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/89734-average-cost-of-cyberattack-now-exceeds-1-million&#34;&gt;In a report by the Global Application &amp;amp; Network Security&lt;/a&gt;, 78% of businesses reported that they experienced a cyber-attack that either caused service degradation or a complete network outage. These network interferences can have significant negative impacts on a company’s balance sheet, which present in the form of business interruption losses due to employees’ inability to perform work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expenditure on cloud computing is projected to increase to $331 billion in 2022, up from $182 billion in 2018, according to Gartner. The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices doubled from 15 billion to 30 billion between 2015 and 2020 and is expected to grow to 75 billion by 2025, based on research by Statista. This explosive growth in the use of digital technology has significant exposure implications for commercial insurers as well as personal lines insurers of homes and autos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber coverage – “affirmative” and “non-affirmative”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after we saw the thread and its impact and meaning, I think the next question should be:  &lt;strong&gt;can companies obtain insurance coverage for cyber-related losses?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes, but the way that an insured obtains such coverage could be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber insurance comes in two forms:  affirmative cyber liability coverage and non-affirmative or “silent” cyber” coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Affirmative cyber coverage is for cyber perils delineated either in a stand-alone network security and privacy policy or in an endorsement covering data breach or network security failure/attack costs. Such coverage could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forensic, public relations and credit monitoring costs associated with a breach &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Business interruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber extortion/ransomware payments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replacement, restoration, or re-creation of damaged or lost data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirmative coverage could also be found in third party liabilities policies. Coverage, as part of this party liability could be through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy liabilities, such as liabilities and defense costs, fines and penalties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network security liability  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulatory defense costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-affirmative, or “silent” cyber coverage refers to cyber losses stemming from traditional property and liability policies. Insureds argue that their policies provide “silent” coverage in different ways, depending on the particular language. Cyber coverage may exist even when a policy does not expressly grant it, when an “all risk” policy does not specifically exclude it, or when an exclusion is ambiguous. As the variety of cyber-attacks continues to grow and develop, so too does the uncertainty surrounding “silent” cyber coverage, leaving the potential for many insureds and other victims of cyber-attacks to seek coverage under a variety of diverse insurance policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; One of the biggest barriers to the provision of affirmative cover for cyber is the lack of data, models and experience. Insurers are faced with the uncertainty that comes with an emerging risk and the challenges presented by the speed at which the risks are evolving - given that so much of our everyday life is &amp;lsquo;cyber-related&amp;rsquo;, many losses under a policy will inevitably have some form of cyber involvement. This is further complicated by the varied and unpredictable nature and motivation behind cyber-attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difficulty in determining, defining and quantifying potential exposure has led to gaps in coverage. In the absence of traditional methods appropriate for analyzing cyber risk, insurers should look to experts and white hat hackers – ethical hackers who use their skills to improve security by exposing vulnerabilities – to help identify and evaluate potential cyber exposure buried within non-cyber policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting things into order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we saw that the cyber security industry has been developed and grew with security solutions, but also faced security incidents that caused significant losses , but more than that, created uncertainty of whether a policy should react for a cyber  event and indemnify the insured or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK regulators identified “non-affirmative cyber” loss under traditional P&amp;amp;C insurance as a threat to insurer solvency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2018, Allianz’s Global Corporate and Specialty unit advised that it was updating coverage in 2019 to provide clarity so that physical damage and bodily injury arising from cyber events would generally continue to be covered under corporate, commercial and specialty policies whereas cyber-related “&lt;em&gt;pure financial loss&lt;/em&gt;” without physical damage or injury would be covered under specific cyber policies only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2019, AIG stated that property and casualty policies should be clear about the cyber coverage they provide, and the company announced a shift to affirmative cyber coverages and exclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/letter/2019/cyber-underwriting-risk-follow-up-survey-results&#34;&gt;In a letter published on 30 January 2019&lt;/a&gt;, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) called on Lloyd’s and the insurance industry to act on the issue of &amp;lsquo;silent cyber&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd’s announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ciab.com/download/19427/&#34;&gt;its response on 4 July 2019&lt;/a&gt;, stating that “&lt;em&gt;It is the PRA’s view that the potential for a significant ‘silent’ cyber insurance loss is increasing with time. As both ‘silent’ cyber insurance awareness and the frequency of cyber-attacks grow, so does the potential from ‘silent’ cyber exposures. Insurance firms may find it increasingly challenging to argue that all risks or other liability policies did not intend to cover this type of risk given the publicity and awareness of the issue&lt;/em&gt;_ … Lloyd’s view is that it is in the best interests of customers, brokers, and syndicates for all policies to be clear on whether coverage is provided for losses caused by a cyber event. This clarity should be provided by either excluding coverage or by providing affirmative coverage in the (re)insurance policy_.” The Lloyd’s letter also mandating that &lt;em&gt;“all policies provide clarity regarding cyber coverage by either excluding or providing affirmative coverage&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first deadlines covers the property market only, and there were numbers of new clauses issued by the market bodies, which includes the LMS for Lloyds and the IUA for the companies market and other committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern of the new clause is that they mainly exclude cyber risk. They distinguish between different types cyber risk, like distinguish between cyber-attack on insured or on a third party which effect on insured and might be different outcome . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, some of the clauses are very hard to follow and are going to lead to confusion, like policies who excludes cyber coverage and then write back specific cyber incident but curve out malicious cyber-attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The challenges of the policy holders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this change of environment and during the transition period, policy holders, might face new challenges such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No consistent approach among the markets across traditional lines regarding affirming/excluding/sub-limiting cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of consistency and market capacity among cyber product solutions in accordance with exclusion introduces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing the gaps in cover that may be created by exclusionary language/sub-limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limitations in cover introduced by non-cyber insurers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the reasons mentioned above, insured should review their policy terms in-depth, and look for locations where exclusions create gaps in coverage, insureds should consider purchasing cyber cover and look at insurer-created solutions where a cyber policy cannot cover what is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy holders would consider the following options when they will review the policies provided to them by insurers and might include “silent Cyber” exclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reject the exclusion&lt;/strong&gt; – by doing so, the insured will lose Lloyds capacity but at least will have more coverage. So, assume an insured reached the required market capacity in an expected cost, rejection could be an option that the insureds should consider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request a less restrictive version&lt;/strong&gt; – this will provide the insured better coverage certainty and retain coverage for some resultant physical perils. From the other hand this choice will put the insured in a situation that some resultants physical perils will still not be covered, and, in most cases, it won’t include coverage for malicious cyber events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept the exclusion&lt;/strong&gt; – it is probable that an insured will choose this path in cases it will seek for the easiest way to get all required capacity in a reasonable/expected cost. This alternative will likely to exclude more resultant of physical loss then expiated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept the exclusion and purchased “gap filler” policy&lt;/strong&gt; – this might be the perfect choice for an insured who looks for the perfect available coverage but, it might come with a costly component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like, that looking a bit behind the horizon, additional changes must happen in the market to provide more clarity and order for insurers and insureds. The remain holes by mean of uncertainty are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber risk definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber risk scope of coverage - malicious intense vs non-malicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid coverage overlap as in cyber policies and property damage policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Virginia Clean Energy Act</title>
      <link>https://nrg.fyi/post/renewable-energy/the-virginia-clean-energy-act/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:43:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nrg.fyi/post/renewable-energy/the-virginia-clean-energy-act/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the US EIA (Energy Information Association), current Virginia’s energy production stand on 8.5GW. 53% from Natural Gas, 31% from nuclear power, 10% from coal fueled and nearly 7% from Renewable Energy (RE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 12, 2020 , Governor Ralph Northam signed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2020/april/headline-856056-en.html&#34;&gt;the Virginia Clean Energy Act (VCEA)&lt;/a&gt;, to accelerate Virginia’s transition to a clean energy environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VCEA sets Virginia on the path for being 100% carbon free by 2045. By reducing carbon pollution, creating new jobs (estimated by additional 30,000 new jobs), developing the  (RE) economy, improving health outcomes for all Virginians, and saving Virginia families and businesses money on their utility bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act has 4 pillars which called the four E’s, that address both the demand and supply of our energy resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enacting a RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standard) target to make the grid 100% carbon free&lt;/strong&gt; –. RE defined as electricity from wind, solar, falling water, and other in-state resources. The VCEA requires the 2 major utilities in Virginia to become 100% carbon free, it set 2045 as the year target for Dominion Energy and 2050 for ApCo. This RPS target comes also with the benchmarking of 45% renewable in the non-nuclear load by 2030. For Dominion, 75% of all RE must come from the Commonwealth in 2025 and beyond. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VCEA create the pathway to Zero carbon in few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Emission permits may be issued post 2049&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All coal fired generation should be retired by 2024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All biomass-fired generation should be retired by 2028&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All other generations that emits carbon should be retired by 2045&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing energy efficiency standards&lt;/strong&gt; – the act intends to create an environment of energy efficiency programs to be “in the public interest”. The act includes a program to reduce energy burden for low-income customers. The act sets an energy efficiency resources standard, requiring third party review of whether energy companies meet savings goals. The VCEA sets energy efficiency renewable standards (EERS) and goals for 2022-2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total annual savings (% of Retail Sales) of energy efficiency over a 2019 baseline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ApCo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advances offshore wind and other RE resources&lt;/strong&gt;– the act defines that offshore wind generation is in “in the public interest”. The VCEA establishes offshore wind as a substantial portion of the RPS as offshore wind comes online and deploys 5,300 MW by 2034 making Virginia a leader in offshore wind state generators. It also includes labor provisions to require the use of the local labor. For Distribution solar, it establishes rooftop solar as a portion of the RP up to 1% of the annual goals beginning in 2021. The VCEA sets targets for energy storage of 3,100 MW of energy storage by 2035, including 2,700MW for Dominion and 400MW for ApCo. It also requires 10% of energy storage to be deployed directly “behind the meter” for power backups at hospitals, government facilities, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a snapshot of the RE requirement from Dominion and ApCp, through 2035&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onshore RE (ApCo) MW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2023&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2024&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2027&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2030&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2035&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6,100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year in service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offshore (Dominion) MW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offshore (ApCo) MW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2028&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,500-3,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2034&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2,100-2,600&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;35% of all RE mw shown in the table above must be third party owned and operated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utilities can use RECS generated by these resources to fulfill their RPS obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage targets are technology agnostic. The primary limitation is that no one storage facilities may comprise over then 500MW of the utilities target with the exception of 1 storage facility of 800MW in Dominion&amp;rsquo;s territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Distributed Clean Power Generation&lt;/strong&gt; – The VCEA set new rules for the Distribution Generation (DG):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1% of the RPS’s will be allocated for DG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raises the Net Energy Metering (NEM) projects cap of the utility projects from 1% to 6%. In addition, not after 2024 (for Dominion) and 2025 (for ApCo), the SCC (Virginia State Corporation Commission) should revisit and set new tariffs for the NEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raises the ceiling size of individual DG projects from 1MW to 3MW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raises to cap of the PPA from 50MW to 1,000MW, for Dominion (split 50-50 between jurisdictions such as school and municipalities, and 500MW to non-jurisdictional) and 40MW to ApCo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Resources:&lt;/p&gt;
