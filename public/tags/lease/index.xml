      <description>A Commercial &amp;amp; Industrial (C&amp;amp;I) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) should be a simple contract whereby a host agrees to purchase power from a system owned by a project company – this should include project company’ obligations that naturally relate to providing such a service, like installing the system and a meter and maintaining insurance. A Net Metering Credit Purchase Agreement should look exactly like a PPA, except that instead of purchasing power, the host purchases net metering credits – and the system will not be co-located with the host (so no access rights, installation requirements, or any other provision relating to the site will be included).</description>
