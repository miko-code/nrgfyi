      <description>The Value of Energy storage in Europe
 Energy storage has been deemed one of the missing links of the energy transition for quite some time now.

      <description>The energy Security Scenario

Waves - Waves assumed that society would prioritize repairing the economy. In Waves this focus on wealth pushes other societal and environmental pressures into the background, until their relative neglect provokes backlash reactions.</description>
