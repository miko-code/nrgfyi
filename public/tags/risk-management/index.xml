      <title>PPA and Net Metering Credit Purchase Agreements</title>

      <description>A Commercial &amp;amp; Industrial (C&amp;amp;I) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) should be a simple contract whereby a host agrees to purchase power from a system owned by a project company – this should include project company’ obligations that naturally relate to providing such a service, like installing the system and a meter and maintaining insurance. A Net Metering Credit Purchase Agreement should look exactly like a PPA, except that instead of purchasing power, the host purchases net metering credits – and the system will not be co-located with the host (so no access rights, installation requirements, or any other provision relating to the site will be included).</description>

      <description>Relaxed credit terms have created opportunities for priming financing outside Chapter 11. In today’s market, drafting holes in sponsor-friendly credit agreements are exploited to avoid the cost and dislocation of a Chapter 11 process. The current trend is an evolution from one type of Liability Management Transaction (LMT), the dropdowns of collateral, toward the other type of LMT, senior new money and non-ratable up tier exchanges. A LMT begins with creditors holding common positions and having common interests in the capital structure identifying each other and forming an ad hoc group.</description>

      <title>Tax equity financing structures</title>

      <description>The two main tax equity structures are sale/leasebacks and partnership/flips. The ITC is a one-time credit against income tax that is based on the amount invested in a facility. The ITC is subject to recapture if, within five years after a facility is “placed in service,” the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of the project or stops using it in a manner that qualifies for the credit – like taking it out of service or permitting the PPA off taker to operate and maintain the project.</description>

      <title>Components driving PPA price and their risks.</title>

      <description>PPA structures are evolving, and the challenge of Hybrid PPAs lies behind understanding and quantifying the benefits of flexibility, and how it’s reflected in the pricing. The risk profile of the asset is the core determinant of its fair value. And since energy storage changes the risk profile of the generation part, this would need to be reflected in the price.&#xA;To understand what’s driving the Hybrid PAP pricing, it would be better to go through how benchmark PPA prices are modelled, and the risk components driving the fair value of the energy.</description>

      <description>As the world continues to advance technologically, the number of cyber-attacks has increased at an alarming rate. A study done by Accenture and the Ponemon Institute, which researched 355 companies in 16 different industries, revealed that between 2014-2018 security breaches have increased by 67%, with an 11% increase in 2018 alone. On their third annual state of cyber resilience, Accenture and the Pnemone institute, found that 10.9% of organizations’ IT budget spent on cyber security, only 60% of the business ecosystem is protected by the cybersecurity program and 40% breaches reached out via this tour.</description>
