      <description>Future energy storage and distribution
It is no longer a secret, nor a great insight, that we are in a revolutionary era in terms of the energy industry. Many technologies , greener and cheaper are implemented , a lot of assets we uses are being electrified (EV&amp;rsquo;s , heating solution) and more and energy , in general becomes more of commodity than an production resource.
With that development, new challenges and limitations arise and create risks for industrial, commercial, and residential uses and processes.</description>

      <description>The Value of Energy storage in Europe
 Energy storage has been deemed one of the missing links of the energy transition for quite some time now. After the vast deployment of standalone storage assets, which tirelessly (and swiftly) respond for duty when the grid needs it, the long-awaited next phase of renewables-plus storage is finally approaching the mainstream!
The term ‘renewables-plus-storage colocation’ has climbed the ladder in the renewable’s vocabulary, particularly in the merchant renewables sphere.</description>

      <description>The energy Security Scenario
This is a summary of the Energy Security Scenarios report made by Shell.
Shell created 3 different energy scenarios - Waves, Islands and Sky 1.5. Each of these was built around possible approaches to climate change action as the world emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Waves - Waves assumed that society would prioritize repairing the economy. In Waves this focus on wealth pushes other societal and environmental pressures into the background, until their relative neglect provokes backlash reactions.</description>

      <description>According to the US EIA (Energy Information Association), current Virginia’s energy production stand on 8.5GW. 53% from Natural Gas, 31% from nuclear power, 10% from coal fueled and nearly 7% from Renewable Energy (RE).
On April 12, 2020 , Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Clean Energy Act (VCEA), to accelerate Virginia’s transition to a clean energy environment.
The VCEA sets Virginia on the path for being 100% carbon free by 2045.</description>
