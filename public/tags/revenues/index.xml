      <description>PPA structures are evolving, and the challenge of Hybrid PPAs lies behind understanding and quantifying the benefits of flexibility, and how it’s reflected in the pricing. The risk profile of the asset is the core determinant of its fair value. And since energy storage changes the risk profile of the generation part, this would need to be reflected in the price.
To understand what’s driving the Hybrid PAP pricing, it would be better to go through how benchmark PPA prices are modelled, and the risk components driving the fair value of the energy.</description>

      <description>Energy storage has been around for a long time. Alessandro Volta invented the battery in 1800. Until recently, Batteries used to provide power at those locations where no grid connection is present, like for starter motors cars, mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices or for emergency power or computer servers. With the last innovations in the energy storage industry, it is clear that energy storage technology and solutions will become crucial element in our life.</description>
