It is no longer a secret, nor a great insight, that we are in a
revolutionary era in terms of the energy industry. Many technologies ,
greener and cheaper are implemented , a lot of assets we uses are being
electrified
([EV's](https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/electric-vehicle-market-5179)
, heating solution) and more and energy , in general becomes more of
commodity than an production resource.

With that development, new challenges and limitations arise and create
risks for industrial, commercial, and residential uses and processes.
Our current power grids weren't designed for the challenges they have
today - from EV's to renewables, climate change and urbanization, so the
grid needs to be upgraded constantly.

To support grid distribution limitations, there is a need to improve and
create more solutions in the field of distribution and energy storage.
Energy storage is essential for the transition to a decarbonized economy
based on renewable energy sources, and energy distribution needs to be
smarter and more resilient.

Due to the fast implementation of EV's, there will be a need to support
the EV's needs in terms of charging and electricity. As of today, most
of the needs are local, and can be resolved through local applications
such as microgrid or even home battery charging stations.

In terms of distribution, we should expect development in the low
voltage network controls. In leveraging the power of distributed
intelligence, which features continuous insight analytics, and control,
utility companies can redefine what is possible with low-voltage network
management.

Today, energy distribution systems are used as a hub through a single
source, power station, that can be either coal, gas, nuclear, hydro,
solar or wind. That energy is then distributed through a high-voltage
grid before being converted to low-voltage at the consumer end using
substations. In the future, while we continue to have the large-scale
energy system, we will see an increase in power generated at the edge of
the network through micro power stations, solar, wind and all forms of
renewables. This will be complemented with battery technologies to store
when needed. To implement this change requires a new grid distribution
and operational system for the major utility companies.

According to the following
[report](https://infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Energy-2021.pdf),
Over the period between 2017-2021, transmission and distribution and
reliability-focused pipeline investments have increased, and outages
have declined slightly. Annual spending on high voltage transmission
lines grew from \$15.6 billion in 2012 to \$21.9 billion in 2017, while
annual spending on distribution systems --- the "last mile" of the
electricity network --- grew 54% over the past two decades. Utilities
are taking proactive steps to strengthen the electric grid through
resilience measures. However, weather remains an increasing threat.
Among 638 transmission outage events reported from 2014 to 2018, severe
weather was cited as the predominant cause. Additionally, distribution
infrastructure struggles with reliability, with 92% of all outages
occurring along these segments. In the coming years, additional
transmission and distribution infrastructure, smart planning, and
improved reliability are needed to accommodate the changing energy
landscape, as delivery becomes distributed, and renewables
grow[.]{dir="rtl"}

Batteries expected to be used for short-term storage while thermal and
mechanical storage will be used for industrial heat and electricity for
mid-term storage and electrolyzes will turn excess power from renewables
will turn excess power from renewables into green hydrogen that can be
stored long term and turned into electricity or transferred to other
sectors of the economy as needed.

These are the 3 trends who impacts the energy value chain:

1.  [Renewables](https://peggysmedleyshow.com/a-primer-on-clean-energy)
    -- technology around renewables is becoming more efficient in terms
    of solar panels, wind farms, heat pumps, safe nuclear, and more.
    Availability across the whole value chain -- from large utilities to
    business and consumers- is critical, and this can enable
    self-generation and provide additional energy back to the grid when
    surplus is generated.

2.  **Batteries**

3.  **Digitalization/Modernization** -- Transformation of the energy
    sector through virtualization will require robust, scalable, and
    reliable communications infrastructure to enable monitoring and
    control leveraging the power. For instance, AI can enable energy
    systems to make intelligent decisions about where, how, and when
    they consume power in real-time. Edge compute platforms can extract,
    store, and utilize data at scales, supported by AI accelerators and
    automated processes , to schedule , manage , and automate the use of
    renewable energy.
